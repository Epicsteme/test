                  This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. Since the theme
                  "Siesta" refers to relaxation, I wanted to make a game that
                  offers a relaxing experience for the players. This was the
                  first time that I worked on a rhythm based game.

                  The scripts and the development process are significantly
                  different in a rhythm based game. In most games, you write the
                  script in such a way as to synchronise the game objects and
                  other elements with the frame rate in order to maintain
                  consistency in gameplay experience. In a rhythm game, however,
                  syncing the game elements with the frame rate causes the
                  gameplay to lose synchronisation with the music.
                  <br /><br />
                  Instead of connecting with delta time, some of the game
                  elements were coupled with real time clock to maintain
                  consistency, especially in the scrolling speed of the arrows.

                  The arrows carry trigger boxes to check for the overlapping of
                  the appropriate arrows. The box sizes are relatively large in
                  size so that the players may not feel pressured to achieve
                  pixel perfect accuracy in a game about relaxation.

                <p>
                  Royalty free music was used for Ode to Joy and the sound of
                  rain. If the player misses too many beats, the rain slowly
                  fades and the sky becomes bright and clear. Owlbert the
                  workaholic owl wakes up from his nap and flies off to work. In
                  order to keep the game less punishing, I kept the music
                  playing and the arrows scrolling so that the players may still
                  continue playing and enjoy the music.

                <p>
                  Krita was used to draw the owl and the background. The owl in
                  the rainy scene is a different game object from the owl that
                  flies off if the rain stops. I used two different objects in
                  order to make it convenient to script its behaviour.
