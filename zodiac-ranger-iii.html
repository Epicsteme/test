            <h3 class="display-6">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              This project was particularly challenging for me as I was in a
              significantly brighter place than usual in personal life. For this
              20-second-game, I chose to build on the mechanics from my previous
              games. The gravity mechanic is inspired by Zodiac Ranger HSS, the
              second game from Zodiac series. The hostile ships' behaviour is
              inspired by Hyper, my first completed project on Unity engine. For
              this game, I worked with an artist,
              <a href="https://lesflaya.itch.io/"> Madi Funk </a> from Canada,
              and a music composer,
              <a href="https://itch.io/profile/j-ontiveros">
                Jonathan Ontiveros </a
              >from USA.

            <h3 class="display-6">Art</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I chose to go with an art style that felt more like a painting and
              less like an old-school space-shooter since painting-like style
              felt more fulfilling. Madi's attention to detail in the artworks
              and animations helped make the game feel more alive.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Audio</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Since it was a 20 second game, I did not want to add a music track
              that would start over each round and make it feel repetitive. I
              asked Jonathan to create a longer track so that the music would
              feel different enough across a few rounds. The music helped set
              appropriate emotion and pacing for the gameplay. The sound effects
              helped make the game feel more immersive.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Gravity</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              A lot of player feedback from ZR HSS conveyed that it was hard to
              reach the outermost NPC (which required player to use intertia
              carefully)
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              For ZR3, I have set player ship's acceleration and top speed to be
              higher than in HSS so that player may easily move around and even
              go beyond the enemy line (it may be challenging to go far or stay
              out there for long while trying to eliminate enemies)
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-comet-trails.jpg"
            />
            <p class="text-center">Comets orbiting</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              One of the most important challenges I faced was conveying
              visually that the star's gravity affects the player ship. Though
              it is not the most effective method, I added little lines (pretend
              comet trails) orbiting the star in the direction that the player
              is expected to orbit the star.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Enemy movement</h3>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Initially, the game would choose randomly from an array of speeds
              and assign different speed to each ship. Though this provided a
              bit of variety, after a few rounds of playtests, it turned out to
              be better to have all enemy ships move at the same speed and have
              the speed increase every time an enemy is shot. This helped in
              maintaining a little bit of adaptive difficulty.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              The enemy count was initially set to eight but since the gameplay
              felt relatively easy, it was increased to 10. The enemies were
              eventually moved further away from the center since the playable
              area did not feel large enough.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Enemy shooting</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The enemies fire one shot per second. The game would randomly
              choose one of the enemies (from a list) as the starting position
              for the missiles.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The enemy missiles move slow enough to allow player to fly around
              them but also fast enough to make it feel challenging.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Player shooting</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Player shooting started out as tap-for-each-shot. This quickly
              became fatiguing over a few rounds. So the player was allowed to
              fire continuously by holding the button down.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-player-shoot.gif"
            />
            <p class="text-center">Player shooting</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              To prevent the game from becoming too easy, each clip is limited
              to a certain amount of shots, and after a clip is emptied, the
              player must wait for it to auto-reload. This helped reduce
              spamming of shots while also helping regulate difficulty.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The fire rate was initially set to be lower than what was set for
              the jam version. It was eventually increased so that the player
              would be able to hit their intended target with relatively less of
              a challenge considering there is no crosshair and the ship is
              turning and moving at its given rate.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In a project where there is going to be a lot of shooting, it may
              be better to have a fixed number of missile prefabs in a queue
              (pool) and call them in and out instead of instantiating new game
              objects each time an enemy or the player fires.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Last five seconds</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In the last five seconds of a round, the camera zooms out
              completely. This would allow player to see more clearly the
              enemies left in the scene.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-zoomout.gif"
            />
            <p class="text-center">Camera zoom out</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Also, the volume lowers for background music along with most sound
              effects. The player would still be able to hear enemies firing,
              ammo reload, and explosions so that there would be a bit of
              heightened awareness of the elements that matter the most in that
              context.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I had to set this carefully, having the audio fade out over time.
              As the sounds fade, the ticking sound effect blends in well
              enough, preventing the experience from feeling abrupt or
              disjointed.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Achievements</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I wanted to learn to implement player achievements. Part of the
              logic is similar to saving the volume settings, and since I was
              already familiar with the latter, laying out groundwork for
              achievements was relatively easy. All that was left to do was add
              booleans to check whether conditions matched enough to unlock an
              achievement.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Adding the few extra booleans was challenging to an extent as it
              required me to change how other mechanics were called or were
              functioning. For example, for the "Kamikaze" achievement to be
              unlocked, I had to change the code so that upon winning, the
              player ship would either become immortal or not depending on
              whether the win state was achieved through kamikaze. I also had to
              change the way player death state called game-restart function so
              that it would show the victory screen instead of lose screen when
              conditions met.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-ach-1.jpg"
            />
            <p class="text-center">Achievement notification</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I almost avoided displaying notifications for when achievements
              unlocked. After taking a break, I put together a canvas game
              object that would exist across scenes along with audio game
              object. I hid the notification item just outside the screen since
              this is a relatively small game and performance is unlikely to be
              affected significantly.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-ach-2.jpg"
            />
            <p class="text-center">Achievement reminder</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              A little gem icon appears on top of Credits button in menu screen
              when an achievement is unlocked, and it disappears after the
              Credits page is opened. The gem moves up and down a little bit in
              order to attract player attention towards the button.
              (Achievements list is put in Credits page rather than in its own
              page since this is a relatively small game meant for a game jam)
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">User Interface</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I considered conveying time/countdown through the use of objects
              within the environment. One of the ideas was to set twenty lights
              on the dyson sphere, and have each one go on or off every second.
              However, this did not feel appropriate enough for the Watsonion
              perspective. It felt easier to comprehend the time in a relatively
              long bar. After trying out a few variations in size and frames, I
              chose to go with a minimalist bar to keep it clear, and made the
              edge a little lean so it did not feel like a default item from the
              game engine. I used the menu buttons' background as fill so that
              it did not feel plain. A little clock icon was added beside the
              bar to help convey what the bar represented.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-ui-timer.jpg"
            />
            <p class="text-center">UI - Time and enemy count</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              To display enemy count, I set up ten enemy sprites and had each
              one change color and transparency for every enemy eliminated. The
              way these are arranged right under the timer, it almost feels like
              a little race between the two UI items!
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
              src="img/zr3-ui-ammo.gif"
            />
            <p class="text-center">UI - Ammo</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              To convey ammo count, I used an icon of the shot itself with
              radial fill. A slightly larger copy of the icon becomes visible
              for a brief moment on top of it in order to provide visual
              confirmation (in addition to audio confirmation) to the player
              that ammo has recharged.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Wohn the space chicken</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              It has become one of my signature moves to include absurd humor in
              the things I create. Absurdity is also one of the themes of the
              game. Building on this, and to entertain the player and myself, I
              added a little image of a chicken in space suit holding an
              almost-regular-looking chicken. The image has a 20% chance of
              appearing each time the Credits page is opened, and it scrolls
              past the screen. It was generated using Stable Diffusion.

            <p class="text-center">Wohn the space chicken</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              As for the question about the name, which chicken is Wohn? Is it
              the one in space suit or is it the almost-regular-looking chicken?
              Are they both seperate chickens or are they the same chicken? Find
              out next time on Dragonba
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3 class="display-6">Did not add</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Initially I had the enemies charge up for a brief moment before
              firing. The idea was to let the player know where the next shot
              was going to come from. However, the way I set the code caused a
              bug where if the player shot the enemy ship that was charging up,
              the code would stop working as intended and none of the enemies
              would fire in that round. I removed the charge-up mechanic instead
              of trying to fix it since I prefered to spend more time and effort
              on the rest of the mechanics.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In restrospect, this could have been fixed by making the enemy
              ship temporarily immortal while it is charging up a shot, or by
              initiating charge-up as a seperate function and checking whether
              the ship is still available after the charge up period.
