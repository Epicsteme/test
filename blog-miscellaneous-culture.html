              Cultural Myopia
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Cultural myopia means seeing the world only through the narrow
              lens of your own culture. It's when people assume that the way
              they think, act, or live is the right way for everyone else too.
              This kind of thinking makes it hard to truly see and appreciate
              the variety and richness of other cultures. Cultural myopia
              usually comes from not having enough exposure to different people,
              backgrounds, or ways of life.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              When someone has cultural myopia, their view of the world becomes
              blurry and limited. They can't see situations clearly because
              they're judging everything by their own standards. This often
              leads to stereotypes and false assumptions, like thinking everyone
              from a certain country acts or believes the same way.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Cultural myopia can also cause misunderstandings. For example, a
              Portuguese woman might laugh at a Scottish man wearing a kilt
              because, in her culture, it looks like a woman's dress. Another
              example comes from British archaeologists excavating Egyptian
              ruins. Some of the statues depicted nudity, and when these were
              brought to Victorian England, many were chipped or broken to hide
              the nude figures.

              Ethnocentrism
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Ethnocentrism means judging another culture by the standards of
              your own instead of trying to understand it on its own terms. It's
              when people see their way of life as the “normal” or “correct” one
              and view others as strange, inferior, or wrong. This mindset often
              grows from pride in one's own culture and leads to assumptions of
              superiority.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Ethnocentrism may be described as seeing one's own group as the
              center of everything and judging all others in comparison. This
              attitude often brings a sense of unity and loyalty within a group
              but also breeds contempt or hostility towards outsiders.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Ethnocentrism can show up in different ways. On a group level, it
              can fuel conflicts between communities or nations. On an
              individual level, it can appear as strong in-group loyalty and
              prejudice against those who seem different.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Ethnocentrism isn't innate; it's learned through social values and
              beliefs. Its most destructive effects have appeared in history
              through genocide, slavery, apartheid, and many violent conflicts.
              The Holocaust is a popular example.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Some global efforts, like the creation of the United Nations or
              the Olympic Games, have sought to counteract ethnocentrism by
              promoting cooperation and understanding across cultures.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In today's world, where about two-thirds of people use the
              internet and social media, technology can either help or harm.
              Studies show that when people engage with diverse viewpoints
              online, it can build tolerance and bridge cultural gaps. But when
              online spaces are closed off to certain groups, they can reinforce
              narrow, ethnocentric thinking.
