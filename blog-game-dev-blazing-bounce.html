          <h2 class="display-6">Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            The game was made for Weekly Game Jam #175 with the theme
            "Two-Button Physics." I've teamed up with an artist, Sangeeth
            Roshan, from the jam's discord server. Though we had initially
            planned on making a puzzle like game with tile based movement, I
            realised that there was not going to be enough time to make more
            than a few levels or polish the game considering my skill level at
            the time. I have prototyped a few concepts and decided to move
            forward with the ball and paddle mechanics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
            class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
            src="img/game-dev-bb-prototype1.gif"
            alt="Prototype animation for Blazing Bounce"
          />

          <p class="text-center">Prototype</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Theme</h2>
          <p>
            Once I had decided which mechanic to build on, I chose to go with
            the theme of rescuing. Instead of a ball breaking blocks, a
            firefighter rescues NPCs in windows.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Level Design</h2>
          <p>
            A total of 32 windows, 4 floors with 8 windows on each floor are
            added. 16 windows to the left and 16 to the right. The broken window
            sprite would be spawned at the start of the level on a random number
            of windows within a fixed range. Flames and NPC sprites would then
            be spawned on a certain number of these windows. This randomisation
            contributes to replayability value.
            <br /><br />
            Each level lasts 60 seconds. This time limit adds a bit of tension
            to the experience while also ensuring that the game does not
            overstay its welcome. This also contributes to replayability value.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
            class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
            src="img/game-dev-bb-prototype2.gif"
            alt="Second prototype animation for Blazing Bounce"
          />

          <p class="text-center">Prototype</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Difficulty</h2>
          <p>
            To add variety and replayability value, I have added easy and hard
            modes along with five levels.
            <br /><br />
            Lvl 1 has 2 NPCs.
            <br />
            Lvl 2 has 4 NPCs.
            <br />
            Lvl 3 has 6 NPCs.
            <br />
            Lvl 4 has 8 NPCs.
            <br />
            Lvl 5 has 10 NPCs.
            <br /><br />
            In easy mode, safety nets exist on either side of the screen that
            bounce the firefighter back into the screen. These nets do not exist
            in hard mode, and the game ends if the firefighter jumps off to the
            side.
          </p>
          <br />

            class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
            src="img/game-dev-bb-easy-levels.gif"
            alt="Animation showing five levels in Blazing Bounce"
          />

          <p class="text-center">Five Levels</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Art</h2>
          <p>
            Sangeeth Roshan created pixel art that fit the theme of the game. A
            variety of NPCs were created to reduce monotony.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Bugs</h2>
          <p>
            The flame has a separate collider from the NPC. Occasionally, the
            flame persists despite NPC getting rescued. I've set it up like this
            towards the end of the project since I did not want to touch the
            scripts and assets that were already in the level. By the time I had
            noticed the bug, it had been a while and I did not want to spend my
            time fixing this occasional bug which does not break the game.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Hindsight</h2>
          <p>
            To convey to the player what their objective is, I could have added
            windows in the middle and spawned an NPC which would automatically
            be rescued since the firefighter begins bouncing in the middle of
            the screen.
