              At the other end of the world, sickness dawned upon my dearest.
              Upon the barren blood of hundred million dead souls, people built
              walls that grazed the skies. Then they burnt the bridges that
              stretched across the sea of tears of thousand million more.

            <h3 class="display-6 fw-bold" id="graham">Graham</h3>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Graham, a rather young planet in a distant world, commanded an
              attraction unlike any other in her system. Whispers of her face
              breezed through aether like melodies in the wind. Every day, her
              host could be caught throwing glances at her. Fine grains of dust
              coated with frozen gases and liquids pilgrimed to her. Every
              night, a thousand streaks of burning light sailed through her
              skies.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Every single comet helped Graham flower; to give rise to a home as
              colorful as the dreams of a child; a budding paradise, on the
              verge of hosting life, about to become a safe haven for souls
              drifting through time.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              One late evening, three moons of a neighboring planet, discontent
              that their host would not support life, took it upon themselves to
              tempt fate. Rakesh, the oldest among them, sang of their host who
              had been touched by a cometoid and fell to decay. He sang for all
              to hear; preached that all must abstain from comets' visits for
              they were evil.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">It was a crescent lie that eclipsed the night.</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The three moons formed an alliance, that they shall not suffer
              pilgrims to greet Graham. It was a pact made not in words but in
              stardust, with aether as their witness. The trio circled Graham,
              and together, they dented space itself, forcing pilgrims to loop
              endlessly around the cold edges of a young starving atmosphere. A
              dazzling system of rings formed around Graham, consisting of
              rocks, ice, debris, and shattered moons.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Spokes of mysterious nature flashed across the rings of Graham
              like lightning in a thunderstorm. Pilgrims began to conspire.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Indumathi, the youngest of the trio, circled Graham from the far
              end. She kept to herself, contemplating aether. Dawa took joy in
              closely following Rakesh, and the two spent countless nights
              revelling in songs of abstinence.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The songs, however pleasant, diluted their pact. None remembered
              the original pact except for aether - but one does not command
              aether nor ask anything of it.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Dawn was nearing. Rakesh and Dawa remembered nothing of the time
              before their songs.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Rakesh called upon Dawa and Indumathi for a summit, believing
              themselves to be prisoners of Graham. He shared with them his plan
              for escape. The only way out, he preached, was through Graham's
              death.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Dawa knew little but to follow Rakesh. Indumathi said that they
              were their own prisoners and that they could just leave if they
              wanted to. They laughed at her words and pitied her, believing she
              had gone mad.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The summit concluded with Rakesh and Dawa agreeing to carry out
              the heinous plot for the murder of malnourished Graham.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Dawa thought that Indumathi must be freed from her madness, and so
              she paid her a visit that night. Indumathi, underestimating the
              willingness of Dawa to act on ignorance, had not prepared to
              protect herself. It was not the last of blood to be spilt that
              night.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              After midnight, Rakesh and Dawa visted Graham and stabbed her in
              her sleep. They were finally free, or so they believed. With
              Graham gone, Rakesh and Dawa became the most prominent presence in
              the region. They had been revelling in abstinence for so long that
              they no longer remembered how to withstand the impact of a rock,
              let alone hundred thousand.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In their final moments of that cycle, they heard the voice of a
              child "Smoke and mirrors do not make you a god no matter how many
              rabbits you pull out of your ass."

              The Forbidden Island
            </h3>

            <br>

            <p class="lh-lg text-center">
              <em
                >"In truth, there was only one Christian, and he died on the
                cross."
              </em>
              <br>
              — Friedrich Nietzsche
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              On an early winter evening, a faction of fishermen gathered on the
              beach on a little island near the Indian ocean. The body of a
              young partisan, riddled with arrows, was pulled from the water.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Among the possessions of the body was a journal describing an
              intent to visit and proselyte the ancient tribe inhabiting the
              forbidden island nearby- the tribe whose faces had been seen only
              by a few since the fall of the British Empire. Among the
              possessions of the body was also a peculiar stone, maybe more of a
              mineral, which I could have sworn belonged to me had I not
              considered there were more of them.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I found on my uncle's desk, when I was young, a stone which had
              been passed down through generations. Its most intriguing
              character, perhaps, was its overall form which resembled the
              weaver bird. It fit in my palm and weighed little. Its smokey
              shades of brown and green were almost hypnotic when light
              reflected off its curves.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Fascinating creatures, weaver birds. I often used to watch them
              weave nests and call for mates. If they didn't find a mate within
              a few days, they would rip apart the nest and start over. At
              times, a rival male would descend to shred another's nest,
              ensuring the female would pass it by.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              My uncle gave me the mineral before he left his house for the last
              time. I hadn't seen the mineral in nearly a decade. His last words
              to me were "curiosity doesn't kill you." I was too young then to
              understand the implications.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              His boxes, retrieved from the dusty attic, are filled with notes,
              most of which are nearly illegible to my sober eyes. According to
              the notes, my uncle visited the forbidden island, before I was
              born, to study the inhabitants and their culture. The tribesfolk
              were not pleased with his visit or to share the details of their
              culture, but for reasons unmentioned here, they made an exception
              for him.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              A comment states that the language spoken on the island could not
              be translated well enough, for they spoke of things undreamable.
              However, it was made known that they believed weaver birds to be
              the equivalent of vessels for gods.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Among his notes is a brief mention of the mineral's history. My
              great great something ancestor borrowed it, permanently, from the
              British colonials after their visit to the forbidden island. More
              importantly, the mineral was not born of this earth, no- it fell
              from the skies many civilisations ago.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              There are also mentions, in the notes, of visitors from worlds
              beyond our own. Centuries before the common era, transdimensional
              anomalies threatened our world. The recorded dates of such
              incidents align with the time periods in which the scientific
              community agrees certain novel and history-altering events
              occured.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The only known defense we have against such transdimensional
              anomalies is the people on the forbidden island. Any threat to
              their culture could spell a fate far worse than the end of the
              world.

              In a valley somewhere, there is a town called Ritchie, known for
              the bridge on which stands an unusual lamp whose curves are
              distorted in ways that are not of this world and whose voice
              utters riddles.

              Birds of the Sky
            </h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked
              wall. Their feathers were of colour akin to that of wood in the
              rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a constellation of tiny
              specks glowed from within. Though they lingered in this world,
              they were not bound to it. These were beings that could exist in
              many worlds at once.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with
              his back to the wall and let out a breath of prayer. As he tossed
              a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him, the creatures
              began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From
              beneath its eyelids, a thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the
              void. The creature flew up to the bowl and indulged itself. The
              rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of
              the child, turning them to cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to
              find the noises still haunting him. The source, he realised, was
              outside.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards
              the door to the balcony. With every step, hesitance slowed him
              further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat louder.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide
              open. An obscure being with a translucent form sat among dense
              clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in ways
              unnatural. It was a creature from another world, come to consume
              this world.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense
              little shades moved in front of the clouds. The winged creatures
              were as fast as their screeches. They were there to defend the
              child and his world. They moved with the grace of a dancer and the
              swiftness of a fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the
              swarm of lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around
              them.

              Puzzle in a River

              Eighty pieces of puzzle riddled down the river. Salty stream
              pulled on my strings. No two pieces fashioned together. Icy
              current stripped me of my soul. Was I the last piece, or was it
              all a lie?

              A saffron sky dawned on us. All our scars on the table. The clock
              racing against the hearts in our hands. Tethered by naught but a
              string of heart. Flushed in a wave of fleeting stars. An unsung
              web of worlds untethered.

              The Space Between
            </h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In a not so distant past, there lived a people who shared a
              fantasy. Mountains of memories formed over many moons for they
              lived and breathed adventure. Hearts of gold melted in the heat of
              passion for each other. Surfing time and tide, they grew
              inseparable.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Knitting a future meant a trek over the horizon. Ashes rained from
              the skies for countless bridges burned. Luxury awaited some and
              some awaited luxury. In the cosmos of time, memories faded of
              many. Howling winds echoed through canyons of eroded dreams.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              There I lay gazing at the sea of stars sailing through the night.
              All that once was may never be again and whom I once knew I may
              never know again.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Warm air accompanied by a melody of footsteps greeted my back. Saw
              did I a sight brighter than day, and soon bridged the space
              between us with an embrace.

            </h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              An ocean of voices condensed all around me. They are but mirages
              in which I drowned. The air turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern
              of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye I lay paralysed, gasping for
              breath.

              The glass, tinted unevenly, did not open. On the other side are a
              great many windows placed symmetrically on walls of unsaturated
              colours. I could not count them all if I had an eternity.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall
              waving their hands at the speeding train. I imagine they must have
              not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass. Would it have been of
              any consequence to return the wave?

              The Gods painted the heavens with a symphony of colours. Never
              have I laid the slightest glance upon a spectacle so terrifyingly
              breathtaking.

              Something peeked out of the sky. Its skewed body, scattered edges,
              and obscure being mocked me.

            <p class="lh-lg">"Does that look like a rabbit to you?"</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I
              wasn't expecting company. To my side is a child whose attention
              could not be taken off the clouds.

              The hind legs make it look more like a hare than a rabbit.

            <p class="lh-lg">
              I gazed beyond to find a thin, subtle yet paralysing stroke of
              violet bordering a thick fiery cloud. With all its might, the sky,
              on fire, roared bright.
