            <p class="lh-lg">Is your religion really your own?</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In about 60 seconds or 200 words, describe your religion and
              explain its limitations or criticisms.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Then, do the same for at least two other religions, one organized
              and one unorganized (Organized religions like Islam, Christianity,
              and Judaism have formal rules, texts, and leadership. Unorganized
              religions like Confucianism, Shinto, and Secular Buddhism are more
              flexible, with no central authority).
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              If you can't do it, it probably means you didn't really think
              about your religion or choose it for yourself. If that is true,
              your religion isn't really yours.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              You have to learn about various religions and their criticisms,
              and then decide for yourself whether to follow one, several, or
              none at all.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Here is a common criticism you must consider. The German
              philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, “the will to a system is a
              lack of integrity.” This means that trying to explain the world as
              a fixed system is not honest. People who make strict systems to
              explain everything twist or ignore certain truths just to make
              their system work. Their main goal is to build a consistent
              system, not to show the world as it really is. So, all religions
              that try to explain everything are naturally biased and can't be
              trusted.
