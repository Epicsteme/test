                has over ten years of experience as a sound designer and content
                creator in the entertainment industry, excelling in platforms of
                audio for music, film, and videogame production. They helped
                develop Audio Design Desk, an A.I software that assists in
                syncing audio with video faster than traditional softwares. It
                won NAB's Product of the Year Award in 2022 and 2023, and is
                being used in productions for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Studios
                among others.

                  What first got you into music? Were there any musicians or
                  media that inspired you?
                </span>
                <br />
                I grew up as a musician and started playing guitar at a very
                early age. Being a 90's kid living on the west coast, I was
                introduced to grunge and punk rock as a kid and was also into
                the local skating scene. Being exposed to that culture is what
                got me into music at a young age. No particular band in mind,
                but the media that inspired me the most was the Tony Hawk Pro
                Skater games which has a perfect blend of punk, hip-hop, and
                metal music. Still to this day, those are my top 3 genres of
                music and I owe all of that to being a 90's kid growing up
                skateboarding.

                <br />
                It's actually been an exciting transition to say the least! I
                have been working the film post-production for about ten years
                now and it has been a great experience to further improve my
                audio engineering skills and techniques. But before I became a
                sound designer for film, I always dreamed of working in the game
                industry. So after my 10 years working on multiple indie films
                and docuseries on streaming services, I decided I wanted
                continue following that dream. Over the last year, I have met
                some of the coolest game developers and sound designers and one
                thing I have noticed is how nice the game dev community can be.
                I have met plenty of mentors who I can now call friends who
                inspired me to learn more about game dev and practice creating
                games and implement sounds effects and music to the game.

                <br />
                I experiment with all different styles and genres of music and I
                just enjoy creating whatever it is I am feeling in the moment.
                One week I will be in the mood for some lo-fi hip hop, other
                weeks I enjoy making synth wave music. My creative process
                varies but most of my creative moments simply begin by
                experimenting with a plug in and asking myself, what can I do to
                the single sound, to make it vibrant. By simply taking things
                one step at a time, I eventually fall down a hole of
                experimenting with sounds until it sounds like melodic rhythm I
                enjoy.

                </span>
                <br />
                I had a great time working on Zodiac Ranger 3. The team was very
                easy to work with and I enjoyed my time creating the sounds
                effects and music for the game. I think what I am most proud of
                was creating the player shooting sound effects. I wanted to
                challenge myself to use only synthesis processing. So I created
                my own patch within my VST (Phase Plant) and created my own
                unique laser gun sound effect using multiple oscillators and
                LFO's to manipulate the sound source. It was a proud moment to
                achieve the desired sound without using any layering of
                pre-existing sound effects.

                <br />
                I think it has its pros and cons to change the industry forever.
                Outside of sound design for games, I have helped develop an
                innovating A.I software that assists editors to sync audio to
                video faster than traditional softwares. It was this development
                where I felt using A.I to assist editors was the right move
                towards beneficiating to use of A.I. Where I think the cons come
                in is the rise of A.I generative technology. Every day,
                generative A.I is growing larger and larger meanwhile our
                regulations cannot move at the same pace. The idea of a photo,
                painting, sound effect, etc. can be generated with a few clicks
                of a button raises a frightening concern for artists in the
                industry. In conclusion, assistive A.I in the industry can be a
                great thing, meanwhile generative A.I can be a negative thing.

                Music Industry Changes

                <span class="fw-bold">
                  If you could change anything about the music industry, what
                  would it be?
                </span>
                <br />
                I would bring back dynamic range in traditional pop culture
                music. In the 90's there was a theory where "the louder the mix,
                the better the sound." This was known as the loudness war, where
                every new artist would compete to have a louder album. While the
                arguement could be made that this theory is true, the reality is
                music lost its dynamic range due to loud mixing of music. If you
                compare Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody to any modern pop artist, you
                will notice a wide difference in the volume and dynamics.
                Today's music is mixed to sound like it is right in front of
                your face, as for older music was mixed to sound like you are in
                the room with the artist.

                To follow your dreams and don't let anyone get in your way.
                Music is subjective and what matters the most is making music
                you are extremely proud of. With today's technology, you can
                become a musician at the comfort of your home. Long gone are the
                days where you would have to invest in thousands of dollars of
                equipment and to rent out a large recording studio, or have to
                hire a manager to get your music out there. You can achieve all
                of that in your own home thanks to rise of home studio gear
                without breaking the bank.

                network with fellow creatives and recruiters in hopes to change
                the trajectory of my career from tv/film sound design, to game
                audio sound design.
