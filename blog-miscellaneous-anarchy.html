              Most online dictionaries define words the way people usually use
              them. That might sound fair, but it can make complicated ideas
              seem simpler than they really are. Dictionaries usually say
              “anarchy” means no order, no organization, or no control. That's
              how people talk about it, but it doesn't reflect what anarchism actually is.

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Anarchism is a political theory that asks whether anyone should
              have the right to rule over others. It values individual freedom
              from domination and promotes caring communities where people are
              equal and decisions aren't forced on anyone.

              Dictionaries make it seem like the only alternative to government
              is disorder. Just like calling democracy "mob rule" is misleading,
              calling anarchism "disorder" is misleading.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Look more closely and you'll see anarchism isn't about
              disorder at all. It's about questioning authority and promoting
              self-governing societies.
