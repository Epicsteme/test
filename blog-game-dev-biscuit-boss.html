          <h2 class="display-6">Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lh-lg">
            This game is a vertical-scrolling 2D platformer with random level
            generation and surreal comedy, designed for casual players in the
            browser. Created for Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2 with the theme "RISK
            IT for the BISCUIT." The jam lasted one week. I was the game
            director and lead developer. I've teamed up with two programmers,
            RobyDev from Spain and Shinespark from USA; an artist, Francisco
            Martins from Portugal; and a composer, Aylinel from Germany.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">The Core Idea</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I came up with the concept for this game while thinking about taking
            risks for collectibles. The player starts at the bottom, climbs up
            the platforms, collects biscuits, and comes back down before the
            time ends. Will the player take a risk and go higher to collect more
            biscuits or will they come back down? The random level generation is
            meant to increase replayability value.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Early Prototyping</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            We started prototyping in Unity. The first version of the level
            generator spawned only one platform per row. At the time, there was
            a possibility that a platform would be spawned right above another
            platform, leading to the player character being unable to climb. I
            resolved this issue through code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Scope and Prioritization</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            We initially considered adding wall jumps, but I discarded the idea
            because our level generation system wasn't ready to reliably produce
            walls, and adding the mechanic would have pushed the scope beyond
            what was feasible in our jam timeframe.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            The early version of level generation included platforms of various
            sizes. I standardized all platforms to a single size. This reduced
            technical complexity, kept scope realistic, and ensured we could
            meet the jam deadline.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I initially considered five enemy types but chose to implement only
            two to keep scope manageable and ensure we met the jam deadline.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Team Coordination</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            We used Github for collaborative development and Google Sheets to
            communicate which tasks needed to be done and in which order.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I implemented player movement, the majority of level generation,
            enemy behaviors, and a few minor elements. Shinespark implemented
            the leaderboard system. RobyDev handled the rest.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            The art style was established before the game concept was finalized.
            Once we had a working level generation system, I was able to
            evaluate the gameplay pacing and guide the composer on the type of
            background music needed. This approach ensured that both the artist
            and composer had sufficient time to create and polish the necessary
            assets.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Iteration and Problem Solving</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            One of the biggest challenges was designing the level. I wanted the
            player to have more than one way to go up. This meant there had to
            be more than one platform per row. I also wanted to have an easy way
            and a hard way. The easy way would have higher chances of spawning
            biscuits and fewer chances of spawning enemies while the hard way
            would have higher chances of spawning enemies and fewer chances of
            spawning biscuits.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            One of the variations I tried had three platforms per row. This was
            discarded as it was not leading to an interesting level design.
            Another variation I tried had only two platforms per row and this
            lead to an occasional problem where the space between the two
            platforms would be too high and the player character would not be
            able to jump from one platform to the other in the same row. I
            solved this problem by measuring the distance between the two
            platforms in a row and spawning a third platform in between them if
            the space was too high. This lead to a balanced level design with
            two platforms in some rows and three in some rows.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            To prevent only one side being easy and the other side hard, I wrote
            the code in such a way that the game would randomly choose between
            left and right side for the easy and hard platforms to be spawned.
            In the early version, biscuits and enemies would spawn on every 5th
            row. This was later changed to every 3rd row. This decision was made
            so that climbing platforms would feel more interesting with
            collectibles and enemies appearing more frequently.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            The enemy drones are spawned on the right side of the screen and
            moved to the left side. At times, the player character would be too
            close to the drone when it was spawned and the player would not have
            enough time to move away from the drone. To solve this problem, I
            wrote the code in such a way that the drone would be spawned only
            when the player character is in the center or left side of the
            screen.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I wanted the round to end when the player reached the boss after
            collecting at least one biscuit. At the same time, falling from a
            height should result in the player's death. We realized this could
            create a conflict: if the player fell near the boss, it might
            trigger unintended behavior or bugs. To solve this, I added a
            platform above the boss, ensuring the player couldn't fall in that
            critical area and maintaining the intended game flow. This decision
            allowed me to enforce clear rules while keeping the gameplay
            predictable and bug-free.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Art, Audio, and Narrative</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I wanted the art style to be painterly and the audio to feel like it
            was made with real instruments. I asked the composer to create
            gameplay background music that would feel similar to Super Mario
            Bros and Double Dragon II themes. I wanted the narrative to feel
            silly and surreal. So, we came up with the idea that an employee is
            being ordered by their boss to carry out a strange task.
