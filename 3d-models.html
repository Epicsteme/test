          At first, it seems like a compass drawing a circle, but the pencil is
          wrongly placed at the center. The user knows one part stays fixed, but
          not which one. The needle is rotated instead, tearing the paper
          instead of drawing smoothly. This confident misuse, based on partial
          understanding, causes damage instead of creation.

        <p class="lh-lg max-width-90 mb-4 mx-auto">
          This artwork was inspired by the quote "If you judge a fish by its
          ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it
          is stupid." Here, the fish is not trying to climb a tree—it
          <i>is</i> the tree. The idea is that you should not judge yourself
          based on someone else's standards but by your own. You are your own
          standard. You are the learner and the standard.

        </div>

        <p class="lh-lg max-width-90 mb-4 mx-auto">
          This artwork was inspired by the story of a blind man who carries a
          lamp at night—not to see, but so others can see him. He borrows the
          idea from a friend, thinking it will keep him safe. However, as he
          walks home, someone bumps into him. The blind man says "Can't you see
          the lamp?" and the other man says “Your lamp isn't lit.” The lantern
          containing the moon is a symbol of borrowed wisdom. The moon
          represents wisdom, much like how certain nocturnal creatures use it to
          navigate. For them, the moon is a fixed point—a dependable guide in
          darkness. Similarly, wisdom serves as a reference system for those
          navigating life. This artwork challenges the idea of relying on
          secondhand wisdom.

        <p class="lh-lg max-width-90 mb-4 mx-auto">
          The teacup represents the mind, and the clouds above symbolize the
          flow of ideas and opportunities. Some clouds bring rain—valuable new
          knowledge or perspectives. However, the cup is already full. Unless
          it's emptied with intention, it cannot receive more. Letting go is an
          essential part of growth. Just like in chess, where you may sacrifice
          a piece to win the larger game, the mind must release old thoughts,
          beliefs, or assumptions at the right time to make room for something
          better. The value is in knowing what to hold, what to release, and
          when.

          A Möbius strip seems to have two sides, but it actually has one. The
          chess theme reflects how the planet feels divided by politics, though
          it's still one planet. The dominoes represent political bodies—if one
          strikes the "other side," it may still be affected in some way. This
          is not about karma.

        <p class="lh-lg max-width-90 mb-4 mx-auto">
          This artwork was partially inspired by the story "Depression is Like
          Snow." Most people who commit suicide are depressed. When someone is
          strongly considering suicide, they develop tunnel vision. Train of
          thoughts in someone depressed is also often affected.

          Some moths use the moon to navigate. For them, the moon is a fixed
          point—a dependable guide in darkness. They become disoriented when
          there are multiple light sources. Deer become overwhelmed and freeze
          in the presence of bright lights. The moons represent various belief
          systems and perspectives of the world. The artist was overwhelmed and
          disoriented by various belief systems and perspectives of the world.
          This artwork reflects the struggle of navigation in life.
