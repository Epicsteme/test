            <p class="lh-lg">
              It had been over a year since I worked on a game project. A 20
              Second Game Jam prompt was a good opportunity for me to refresh my
              memory of the process of game development. The focus of the jam
              was on the honing of skills necessary to polish the core elements
              of a game in order to grab the players' interest in a short amount
              of time and have them wanting more. For this project, I've teamed
              up with an artist and a music composer,
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aprilrawipa.art/">April</a> and
              <a href="https://soundcloud.com/clairebun">Claire</a>, from the
              jam's Discord server.

            <h3 class="display-6">Theme</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The jam offered a range of themes to choose from and they were all
              optional. I have leaned towards the theme "rocket" since, at the
              time, I was interested in the physics mechanics, inertia and
              gravity assist.

            <h3 class="display-6">Title</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              This was initially going to be the third game in the Zodiac Ranger
              series, but I have chosen to keep this game as a stand-alone
              project for a few reasons including the following: all the games
              in the Zodiac series so far are set in an environment where the
              player's ship rotates around an object as a result of gravity, and
              gravitational slingshot is the essence of those games which is
              missing here. I have chosen the name "Who opened the hatch?" since
              it felt like a question that could pique curiosity and it also
              sounded funny.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="display-6">Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I wanted to make use of inertia as one of the core mechanics since
              I find a mix of control and randomness to be quite enjoyable at
              this time. I have decided that a fixed screen would be efficient
              since it would cost considerable amount of time to move around an
              object like in Zodiac series. Once I've established that I wanted
              a fixed-screen game, I had to choose a role for gravity. To do
              this, I needed to see what the level looked like and I had to
              playtest it a few times with different parameters.

            <br>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              I've set up a 2x4 grid where each "cell" contains a script for
              spawning tiles. Each spawner consists of nine slots (positions) in
              a 3x3 grid layout. A specific number of these slots would be
              chosen randomly at the start of the level and tiles would be
              spawned in these slots. Some of the ideas that I have considered
              and prototyped are:
              <br>
              <li>Gravity being enabled and disabled.</li>
              <li>Various grid layouts, spacings, tile counts.</li>
              <li>Get to the destination without touching any tiles.</li>
              <li>
                Play as an astronaut who needs to pick up minerals in space and
                return to ship.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pick up the astronauts that are spawned at semi-random positions
                in each cell and get to the destination.
              </li>

            <br>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Though I have started with the idea of gravity being enabled, I
              have decided to disable the gravity after a few playtests since it
              felt better to keep the ship moving without resistance. If gravity
              were enabled, the gameplay would have been much more similar to
              Lunar Lander. It is not an implication that one is better than the
              other- they are different mechanics and it is more of a personal
              preference.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class="display-6">Spawning the Level</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I have made a list of slots (positions) from which one slot is
              randomly chosen by the spawner at the start of the level to spawn
              a rock in. From the remaining slots, 2 slots will be randomly
              chosen to spawn NPCs in. I have decided to reduce the number of
              rocks since it would allow more space for players to move around
              in and enjoy the smooth flow of the ship while also keeping an eye
              out for the rocks. Now it feels way more relaxing since the focus
              is shifted towards embracing flight as opposed to focussing on
              constantly avoiding rocks.

              I was focussing on refreshing my memory more than I was trying to
              make a polished game at the beginning of the project. Some of the
              earlier assets used involved Kenney's sprites as well as my own.

              I've made a few prototypes for the timer UI. An oxygen tank seemed
              to be a decent idea that fit well with the premise of the game.
              Once I had a stable foundation for the game and realised that I
              would be able to complete the project, I have teamed up with an
              artist,
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aprilrawipa.art/">April</a>
              from jam's Discord server. Though they were relatively new to
              producing game art at the time, they were able to adapt quickly
              and deliver quality content. <br><br>
              As I have tried pixel art a few times in the past, I wanted to
              experiment with a different art style. Inspired by games like
              Hollow Knight and Cuphead where the visuals feel like traditional
              visual art, I wanted to try an art style that would resemble a
              painting.
            </p>

            <br>

            <div>
              <img
                class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded"
                src="img/game-dev-woth-ship-col.jpg"
              />
              <p class="text-center">Collider on the ship</p>
            </div>

            <br>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              The artist made a few rough sketches of the assets and a variety
              of options to choose from. I have chosen this model of the ship
              since I felt that its silhouette was visually way more attractive
              and seemed suitable for a ship that would be used for rescuing
              astronauts in the game.
              <br><br>
              In terms of functionality, a ship with length and width close to
              1:1 ratio is likely to do better in terms of collision with
              environment since spinning on its own axis is a significant
              mechanic in this game. Spinning with an elongated collider is
              likely to cause inconveniences in the level such as hitting a rock
              which the ship would have not hit were it facing a different
              direction. This decision was made to make the gameplay convenient
              for the players.
              <br><br>
              Perhaps I could have added an elongated collider and designed the
              level in such a way that players could choose between an easy
              route and a high-risk, high-reward play style. This would require
              a good amount playtesting, of course.
              <br><br>
              The colour of the ship was chosen to contrast the background. The
              astronauts were also chosen to be of similar colour since it
              conveys better that the astronauts and the player ship are
              associated while also standing out from the background.

              The colours of the rocks make them fit in with the environment but
              also stand out just enough for the players to easily spot them.
              There are two different rock sprites and the script randomly
              chooses one of them at the start of the level. Initially, I have
              allowed both the sprites to be used in each game, but I have
              noticed that it feels relatively refreshing to have them show up
              separately.
              <br><br>
              For my earlier projects, I have often used royalty free assets
              that were made by experienced and dedicated game artists. This
              meant that I had little to worry about how well they fit in the
              scene. Now that I was having assets created, I had to make sure
              that the resolution at which they were being imported into the
              engine fit well with the size of the scene, the target screen
              resolution, and that the renderer parameters in Unity were set
              appropriately to have the images appear in the best way possible
              without having pixels glitching.

            <h3 class="display-6">Music</h3>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              I have teamed up with a music composer,
              <a href="https://soundcloud.com/clairebun">Claire</a>, from the
              jam's Discord server. They were able to understand the needs and
              produce quality audio for the game. <br><br>
              The music was designed specifically to highlight the randomness
              that comes with inertia while also focussing on the control that
              the player has on the ship. All this was done while preserving a
              pace that keeps the players' energy up.
              <br><br>
              To build hype and reduce monotony, I have chosen the audio
              feedback for the NPCs to be escalating each time the player
              rescued an NPC.
              <br><br>
              To save time, I have used Kenney's audio resources as placeholders
              and set up the code and components while Claire was working on the
              music.
              <br><br>
              While I already knew how to have one music track looping in the
              background across multiple scenes, I learned to implement two
              music tracks that would span across multiple scenes depending on
              whether the player is in the menus or restarting the level.
              <br><br>
              I have also learned to use One Shot in Unity which I used for NPC
              feedback and explosion sound effects. One Shot is basically "start
              and forget" since it cannot be stopped; the benefit is that one
              audio source component can be used multiple times and for multiple
              audio clips. An example I found while learning about this is of a
              cube that is being thrown around in a room and the thuds being
              played repeatedly while also overlapping.

            <p class="lh-lg">
              I've written a script that changes the pitch of the engine sound
              within a fixed range depending on the ship's speed in order to
              reduce monotony and to make it feel like the engine is behaving as
              expected.
              <br><br>
              The pitch value changes between 0.5 and 3. The maximum magnitude
              of ship's velocity is set to be 4. The magnitude is divided by 4
              in order to bring it under 1, and then it is multiplied by 3 since
              the top limit of the pitch I have assigned is the value 3. The
              bottom clamp, 0.5, ensures that the engine sound does not
              completely stop even if the ship is stationary or moving at a very
              low speed.

            <p class="lh-lg">
              To make the game feel alive, I've added visual juice and subtle
              details. There would be shooting stars in the background that fly
              across the screen every few seconds.

            <br>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Instead of spawning new shooting stars each time, I had only three
              game objects which return to the starting position on the x axis.
              After travelling a certain distance within a fixed range, the
              script chooses a random position on the y axis, a random speed, a
              random length for the body- all within fixed ranges.
              <br><br>
              These controlled changes allow the shooting stars to appear as
              different objects. This is perhaps not the best way to achieve
              this effect but this was added towards the end of the project - I
              chose to quickly put something together that got the job done
              instead of worrying too much about efficiency considering the
              scope and size of the game.
              <br><br>
              I have initially tried to make the stars in the background twinkle
              as well, but it was taking more effort than what I was willing to
              put in at the time to make it look and feel as desired.

                The rocks and the astronauts carry scripts that make them spin

                randomly at the start of the level for each rock and astronaut.
                The script on the rocks also makes the rock sprite stretch by a

            <p class="lh-lg">
              The first bug I had come across was a music track playing in only
              one ear. However, the other sound effects were playing in both the
              ears. I fixed this by resetting the parameters of the audio source
              component in Unity when I found that some of the values were not
              in their default state.
              <br><br>
              The game would stop responding upon starting the level but not
              when I start from the settings menu. I narrowed down the
              possibilities to audio script which remains across scenes. I've
              tried changing the code for how background music gets called upon
              scene transition, but it did not fix the problem. I then found
              that I was setting the volume of level's background music after
              loading the level by taking the value of the volume slider instead
              of the slider's value which is saved in a variable. I fixed this
              by removing the reference to the slider which does not exist
              anywhere outside settings menu and replacing it with a reference
              to the variable that keeps a copy of the value set by the volume
              slider.
              <br><br>
              In one of the playtests, I found the audio being delayed in the
              game build but working as expected in the engine's editor. I fixed
              this delay by using wired earphones instead of bluetooth
              earphones.

            <p class="lh-lg">
              Information is key to the player and when the player fails at
              something in the game, it should not be due to the reason that the
              game did not give them adequate information.

              I was originally going to set the screen boundaries to be lethal
              but chose to leave a few pixels of safe space beyond the edges so
              that if players accidentally got too close, they would still have
              a little breathing room to turn around and get back to safety.
              However, this has caused confusion to some playtesters since it
              was not indicated clearly where the boundaries exactly were. To
              deal with this, I have added a red glow at the boundaries that
              light up on that respective side of the screen to indicate danger
              if the player touches the screen's boundary.

              If you are a developer and your game's difficulty level seems
              reasonable to you, it is likely extremely challenging to the
              players. Some playtesters have said that it was difficult to
              maneuver the ship. I tweaked the ship's maximum velocity,
              acceleration, and turn speed a few times to make the game playable
              to a wider range of players.
