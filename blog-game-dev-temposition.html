                  The participants of Secret Santa Jam 2020 write to each other
                  anonymously and each member receives a letter containing
                  information regarding the interests of the writer. We had to
                  develop a game that includes something relevant to the
                  interests of the writer. The person who wrote to me offered a
                  choice between a rhythm based game and a visually appealing
                  platformer.

                  While researching platformers and rhythm games, I found a game
                  called "140" where the level and the platforms are in sync
                  with the background music. I wanted to try and make something
                  similar. This would include both the choices I was offered-
                  rhythm based and visually appealing platformer.

                  I chose to make a platformer instead of something like Rhythm
                  Heaven Fever since I wanted to improve my skill in designing
                  platformer levels. Though this game does not have a remarkable
                  level design, I did learn a few new things and set a direction
                  for the improvement of my skills.
                  <br><br>
                  I created a behaviour script that I used as a template for
                  most of the platforms. The values for movement speed, start
                  position and end position were manually entered for each
                  platform after attaching the script to allow better control
                  over level design.

                  A subtle detail that I added to the audio visualiser is that
                  each bar has a different set of values: the sensitivity and
                  maximum height of the bars in the higher difficulty areas are
                  higher than that of the bars in the lower difficulty areas of
                  the level.

                  The audio visualiser flashes random colours in sync with the
                  beats. This may be a potential trigger for those who suffer
                  from epilepsy or have health conditions that are triggered by
                  bright flashing lights. I added a clear warning of the
                  flashing lights in both the download page as well as in the
                  main menu of the game. In retrospect, I realise that I should
                  have added an option to disable the flashing of the
                  visualiser, and display the warning in the loading screen as
                  well.
