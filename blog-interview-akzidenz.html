              <a href="https://akzidenz.itch.io/">Akzidenz</a> is an indie game
              developer and co-host of five game jams including the 20 Second
              Game Jam which received over 500 submissions. Akzidenz has
              published 12 games on Itch, and their latest game, Too Easy,
              subverts player expectations.

            <span class="fw-bold">Tell me a little bit about yourself. </span>
            <br />
            I have a mixed background beginning with art school. I have worked
            as a multimedia/web designer and developer, advertising art director
            and copywriter and now work in a management role in a small software
            company. I've always had an interest in interactive design,
            especially on the more creative end, but I've done less and less of
            it over the years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              What inspired you to get into game development?
            </span>
            <br />
            In 2020, stuck in COVID lockdown, looking around for ways to
            mitigate the looming sense of dread, I started looking around at
            game engines. Making games is something I had wanted to try and most
            of the skills involved are ones that I've either done professionally
            or as a hobby at one time or another so it was a natural fit. I
            published my first little game on itch.io in 2020, at the age of 49.
            I came late to this party but you'll have a hard time getting me to
            leave.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold"> Why did you choose DragonRuby? </span>
            <br />
            I auditioned some game engines and didn't find anything that suited
            me particularly well. I've worked with a lot of different tools over
            the years and I have a few opinions about the way I want to work. I
            like to be able to build things from the bottom up. I have a loose
            idea I want to try, I work on it, I discover things I like and lean
            into them, or I discover things I don't like and change them. The
            more a program wants me to do something in a given way, the harder
            it is for me to experiment with different ideas, evaluate them and
            iterate. Some engines that I tried seem to be geared towards making
            the same kind of games as everyone else and just tweaking them or
            dressing them up. That's not something I want.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I found DragonRuby Game Toolkit by chance when I was looking through
            an itch bundle and decided to check it out. Two hours later I had
            most of the abilities I needed to be able to make a simple 2D game
            and iterate on it. It ran fine on my little laptop, allowed me to
            publish to web and desktop platforms with ridiculous ease, gave me
            an upgrade path that would let me publish to mobile and consoles in
            the future and wasn't creatively stifling. Then I found the Discord,
            the phenomenal community, the passionate and accessible development
            team.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              How did you come up with the idea of 20 second games?
            </span>
            <br />
            The 20 Second Game Jam started life on the DragonRuby Discord. There
            hadn't been any game jams for the DragonRuby community so a few of
            us decided to set one up. We wanted to make a low-stress jam with a
            low barrier to entry that would be as appealing to beginners as it
            would be to experienced devs. We settled on the theme of 30 second
            games to help participants manage the scope of their games while
            also posing a design challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            Amir Rajan, one of the creators of DragonRuby, suggested we lower
            the time limit to 20 seconds. Somewhere locked away in the vaults of
            the Game Developers Conference there is a presentation that explains
            how 20 seconds is the average time a player will give an indie game
            before making up their mind to keep playing or jump ship. I still
            haven't managed to find that video but the principle is a good one.
            Indie devs have an absurdly short time to make an impact on the
            player and 20 seconds is just about long enough for one turn of a
            good, fun game loop.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            That's how the TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam started. For our
            third year, we decided it was too good to keep to ourselves. So we
            changed the name to the 20 Second Game Jam and opened it up to the
            rest of the world, regardless of game engine.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              What challenges did you face while hosting the 20 Second Game Jam?
            </span>
            <br />
            There were a lot of participants which gave us some extra work to
            do. The jam attracted a ton of spam submissions that had to be
            manually verified and removed. We had also decided to check that
            every game follows the rules of the jam and that was time-consuming
            for the whole team of hosts.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            People came to us with a lot of questions that really boiled down to
            the same thing: where exactly is the line that decides what is a 20
            second game and what is not? Some questions we tried to clear up in
            the FAQ but most questions like this have specific example and we
            preferred to give them individual answers rather than give some kind
            of exhaustive list of dos and don'ts.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            One thing that we expected to have more trouble with was community
            management but it turned out not to give us much trouble. It was a
            genuine pleasure to hang out with the participants in the jam's
            discord channel.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            My own biggest problem was that the jam became my main focus after
            my day job and my home life. There was a real danger that I wouldn't
            be able to complete my own game for the jam. When it became clear
            that I would not have time to complete the game I was working on, I
            quickly threw something together with a much smaller scope.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              What can you tell about your experience with the co-hosts of the
              jam?
            </span>
            <br />
            The current jam hosts came together for our previous jam and I hope
            everyone can stick around for the future because it's a great team.
            It's not a full time job for any of us and we need to be able to
            rely on other people to step up when real life gets in the way.
            Making decisions, big or small, is much faster with team members who
            are able to express what they do or don't like and are willing to be
            flexible. Verifying that the games followed the jam rules would have
            been an overwhelming task for a single person.
          </p>

          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              What inspired you to make the game Too Easy?
            </span>
            <br />
            Due to lack of time, I ditched the game I was working on and pivoted
            to something that could be executed quickly. The simplest game I
            could think of was to take the most basic interactions (click this
            thing, drag that thing, rollover this thing) and string them
            together into a continuous 20-second experience. Each interaction
            takes a second or two to perform and it demands a little skill to
            figure out what you have to do next. But it's a bit flat as an idea
            so, to make it spicy, the second half of the game is a repeat of the
            first half with a cruel twist: the mouse axes are inverted, rotated
            or otherwise altered in a way that messes with people's
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I had a lot of fun picturing players when, suddenly, nothing behaves
            the way they think it should. I didn't want to spoil the surprise so
            the presentation of the game is intended to reinforce the easiness
            of the first part of the game and the difficult part is only hinted
            at. I got a good few bug reports from people who thought the mouse
            input was broken.
          </p>

              What plans do you have for the future in game development and game
              jams?
            </span>
            <br />
            I'll keep on making games and making jams. I find them both to be
            rewarding activities. I'm particularly enjoying making amateur games
            without deadlines, deliverables or market driven goals so I don't
            have any plans to move into professional game dev. If, by accident,
            I stumbled onto a way to continue to have fun while making some
            modest income from games, that would be great, but I'm not chasing
            it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="lh-lg">
            <span class="fw-bold">
              What advice do you have for someone who wants to host a game jam?
            </span>
            <br />
            There's very little risk in making a jam so don't be afraid to try
            something even if you're not sure it will work. In the worst case
            scenario, people won't join.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            Getting people to join a jam is always going to be a challenge
            unless they already know your name. I'm not sure if we solved that.
            The jam was featured by itch.io a few days before the start date and
            that gave it a massive boost in visibility. So the best advice I can
            give is “be a featured jam”. How games get featured by itch is still
            quite opaque to me though.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            Aside from that, try to have a simple idea and communicate it
            clearly. Like games, people will only give your jam a few seconds to
            persuade them to stick around so you have to make them count. The
            name of the jam should already be telling people what to expect. If
            you can't do that, the next line after the title should make
            everything understood. If that doesn't do it, simplify the idea.
