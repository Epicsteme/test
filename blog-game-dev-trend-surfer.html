                  This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. The theme was "chain
                  reaction." This was the first time that I took part in a game
                  jam, and it was also the first time that I worked with a
                  deadline as short as one week. I teamed up with JDR, a
                  developer that I met in the Jam's Discord server. We helped
                  each other work on our own individual games rather than
                  collaborate on a single game due to the significant
                  differences in our schedules. We shared and bounced ideas off
                  of each other, exchanged feedback, play-tested and helped
                  polish each other's games.

                  As it was the first time that I attempted to make a game under
                  a week, I had no idea on how to manage my time effectively.
                  JDR introduced me to Trello, which I used to prioritise the
                  game mechanics and plan out the development of the game. Most
                  of the week was spent on polishing the level and fixing bugs.
                  I implemented the core gameplay, pause menu, main menu, and
                  uploaded a playable version before the deadline.

                <h3 class="display-6">Level Design</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                  Designing a level was a rudimantary skill at the time. I
                  looked up key-terms relevant to the theme and found a few
                  interesting results of random objects set in a
                  dominoes-like-effect. I thought that it would be cool to have
                  a level in which all the platforms are set in a chain
                  reaction.
                  <br><br>
                  Though I used physics simulation for only some parts of the
                  level, I managed to maintain the appearance of a chain
                  reaction throughout the level. As I was not yet experienced
                  enough with level designing, I could not build a bigger level
                  or multiple levels. Using platforms with diverse mechanics, I
                  built one level which can be completed in approximately one
                  minute.

                  A large ball in the level was supposed to hit a pillar that
                  would knock pillars over. However, when the ball touched the
                  first pillar, it did not tip over in some playtest sessions.
                  To fix this, I decreased the mass of the pillars, increased
                  the mass and the force of the ball, increased the torque on
                  the pillars by a reasonable amount to make sure that they
                  would completely tip over but not spin like a top. The pillars
                  now tip over as expected.
