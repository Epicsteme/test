              The morals you hold dear may be merely products of unchallenged
              tradition.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The best ideas emerge when people are forced to debate and defend
              them. When ideas are challenged, they are subjected to scrutiny
              that can reveal their strengths and weaknesses. The more an idea
              survives debates, the more it may become acceptable.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Anyone who understands only their own side of an argument
              understands very litle of it. Understanding opposing viewpoints is
              essential to forming a well-rounded opinion.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Throughout history, various practices and beliefs have undergone
              significant scrutiny and transformation. Notable examples include
              foot binding, witch hunts, sati, human sacrifices, feudalism,
              child labor, caste discrimination, racial segregation,
              colonialism, slavery, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Most members of society follow conventional morality, which is
              generally based on external elements such as culture, religion,
              and tradition.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Relying solely on conventional morality can lead to a dangerous
              complacency, where we stop questioning, stop reflecting, and
              simply accept what we are told without thought. This can lead to a
              failure to understand the complexities of moral issues and the
              nuances of different perspectives.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              You have to assess the worth of contemporary morality by examining
              and critiquing the socio-historical process that created it. Check
              whether moral beliefs and accepted practices can withstand
              rigorous scrutiny. Find out whether they are based on outdated or
              flawed premises. Evaluate whether they are rationally defensible
              and fit the available facts.
            </p>

              The condemnation of homosexuality is sometimes based on the idea
              that it can be acquired. However, this idea has no scientific
              support. In several countries, laws against homosexuality come
              from legal codes established during the British Empire. The laws
              on this matter were influenced by Christian beliefs. Many people
              feel disgust towards homosexuality, influenced by the beliefs of
              Abrahamic religions. However, as the philosopher Friedrich
              Nietzsche argued, the will to a system is a lack of integrity.
              This means religions that try to explain everything are naturally
              biased and can't be trusted.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Many people are trapped in fear and laziness and do not think for
              themselves. To truly grow, you need to break free from reliance on
              authority (government and religion). Genuine understanding
              requires courage, self-reliance, and a commitment to actively
              using one's own reasoning abilities.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              You must think critically (about your actions) rather than simply
              following societal norms. You have to realize that individuals are
              separate entities from society, and that your own perspective may
              carry more weight than others' views. You have to live by your own
              ethical principles which should include fundamental human rights
              such as life, liberty, and security.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              True moral value comes when you scrutinize conventional morality
              and freely choose your beliefs and commitmentsâ€”not when you are
              simply born into them, follow them out of obligation or societal
              pressure, or rely on others to tell you what to believe.
            </p>
