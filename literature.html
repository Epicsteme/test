                      At the other end of the world, sickness dawned upon my
                      dearest. Upon the barren blood of hundred million dead
                      souls, people built walls that grazed the skies. Then they
                      burnt the bridges that stretched across the sea of tears

                      In a not so distant past, there lived a people who shared
                      a fantasy. Mountains of memories formed over many moons
                      for they lived and breathed adventure. Hearts of gold
                      melted in the heat of passion for each other. Surfing time
                      and tide, they grew inseparable.

                      Knitting a future meant a trek over the horizon. Ashes
                      rained from the skies for countless bridges burned. Luxury
                      awaited some and some awaited luxury. In the cosmos of
                      time, memories faded of many. Howling winds echoed through
                      canyons of eroded dreams.

                      once knew I may never know again.

                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      On an early winter evening, a faction of fishermen
                      gathered on the beach on a little island near the Indian
                      ocean. The body of a young partisan, riddled with arrows,
                      was pulled from the water.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Among the possessions of the body was a journal describing
                      an intent to visit and proselyte the ancient tribe
                      inhabiting the forbidden island nearby- the tribe whose
                      faces had been seen only by a few since the fall of the
                      British Empire. Among the possessions of the body was also
                      a peculiar stone, maybe more of a mineral, which I could
                      have sworn belonged to me had I not considered there were
                      more of them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      I found on my uncle's desk, when I was young, a stone
                      which had been passed down through generations. Its most
                      intriguing character, perhaps, was its overall form which
                      resembled the weaver bird. It fit in my palm and weighed
                      little. Its smoky shades of brown and green were almost
                      hypnotic when light reflected off its curves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Fascinating creatures, weaver birds. I often used to watch
                      them weave nests and call for mates. If they didn't find a
                      mate within a few days, they would rip apart the nest and
                      start over. At times, a rival male would descend to shred
                      another's nest, ensuring the female would pass it by.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      My uncle gave me the mineral before he left his house for
                      the last time. I hadn't seen the mineral in nearly a
                      decade. His last words to me were "curiosity doesn't kill
                      you." I was too young then to understand the implications.

                      His boxes, retrieved from the dusty attic, are filled with
                      notes, most of which are nearly illegible to my sober
                      eyes. According to the notes, my uncle visited the
                      forbidden island, before I was born, to study the
                      inhabitants and their culture. The tribesfolk were not
                      pleased with his visit or to share the details of their
                      culture, but for reasons unmentioned here, they made an
                      exception for him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      A comment states that the language spoken on the island
                      could not be translated well enough, for they spoke of
                      things undreamable. However, it was made known that they
                      believed weaver birds to be the equivalent of vessels for
                      gods.

                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Among his notes is a brief mention of the mineral's
                      history. My great great something ancestor borrowed it,
                      permanently, from the British colonials after their visit
                      to the forbidden island. More importantly, the mineral was
                      not born of this earth, no- it fell from the skies many
                      civilisations ago.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      There are also mentions, in the notes, of visitors from
                      worlds beyond our own. Centuries before the common era,
                      transdimensional anomalies threatened our world. The
                      recorded dates of such incidents align with the time
                      periods in which the scientific community agrees certain
                      novel and history-altering events occured.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      The only known defense we have against such
                      transdimensional anomalies is the people on the forbidden
                      island. Any threat to their culture could spell a fate far
                      worse than the end of the world.

                      In a valley somewhere, there is a town called Ritchie,
                      known for the bridge on which stands an unusual lamp whose
                      curves are distorted in ways that are not of this world
                      and whose voice utters riddles.

                      Dungeons of the deepest I have crept. Dead civilisations
                      roar through time like echoes of the past. Heaven and hell

                      Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a
                      cracked wall. Their feathers were of colour akin to that
                      of wood in the rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a
                      constellation of tiny specks glowed from within. Though
                      they lingered in this world, they were not bound to it.
                      These were beings that could exist in many worlds at once.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He
                      sat with his back to the wall and let out a breath of
                      prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in
                      front of him, the creatures began to move. In the midst of
                      the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its eyelids, a
                      thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The
                      creature flew up to the bowl and indulged itself. The rest
                      waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the
                      dreams of the child, turning them to cryptic nightmares.
                      He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The
                      source, he realised, was outside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved
                      towards the door to the balcony. With every step,
                      hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger,
                      his heart beat louder.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door
                      wide open. An obscure being with a translucent form sat
                      among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around
                      it in ways unnatural. It was a creature from another
                      world, come to consume this world.

                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night.
                      Dense little shades moved in front of the clouds. The
                      winged creatures were as fast as their screeches. They
                      were there to defend the child and his world. They moved
                      with the grace of a dancer and the swiftness of a fighter.
                      The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm of
                      lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                      Whispers of her face breezed through aether like melodies
                      in the wind. Every day, her host could be caught throwing
                      glances at her. Fine grains of dust coated with frozen
                      gases and liquids pilgrimed to her. Every night, a
                      thousand streaks of burning light sailed through her

                      paradise, on the verge of hosting life, about to become a
                      safe haven for souls drifting through time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      One late evening, three moons of a neighboring planet,
                      discontent that their host would not support life, took it
                      upon themselves to tempt fate. Rakesh, the oldest among
                      them, sang of their host who had been touched by a
                      cometoid and fell to decay. He sang for all to hear;
                      preached that all must abstain from comets' visits for
                      they were evil.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      It was a crescent lie that eclipsed the night.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      The three moons formed an alliance, that they shall not
                      suffer pilgrims to greet Graham. It was a pact made not in
                      words but in stardust, with aether as their witness. The
                      trio circled Graham, and together, they dented space
                      itself, forcing pilgrims to loop endlessly around the cold
                      edges of a young starving atmosphere. A dazzling system of
                      rings formed around Graham, consisting of rocks, ice,
                      debris, and shattered moons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Spokes of mysterious nature flashed across the rings of
                      Graham like lightning in a thunderstorm. Pilgrims began to
                      conspire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Indumathi, the youngest of the trio, circled Graham from
                      the far end. She kept to herself, contemplating aether.
                      Dawa took joy in closely following Rakesh, and the two
                      spent countless nights revelling in songs of abstinence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      The songs, however pleasant, diluted their pact. None
                      remembered the original pact except for aether - but one
                      does not command aether nor ask anything of it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Dawn was nearing. Rakesh and Dawa remembered nothing of
                      the time before their songs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Rakesh called upon Dawa and Indumathi for a summit,
                      believing themselves to be prisoners of Graham. He shared
                      with them his plan for escape. The only way out, he
                      preached, was through Graham's death.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Dawa knew little but to follow Rakesh. Indumathi said that
                      they were their own prisoners and that they could just
                      leave if they wanted to. They laughed at her words and
                      pitied her, believing she had gone mad.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      The summit concluded with Rakesh and Dawa agreeing to
                      carry out the heinous plot for the murder of malnourished
                      Graham.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      Dawa thought that Indumathi must be freed from her
                      madness, and so she paid her a visit that night.
                      Indumathi, underestimating the willingness of Dawa to act
                      on ignorance, had not prepared to protect herself. It was
                      not the last of blood to be spilt that night.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      After midnight, Rakesh and Dawa visted Graham and stabbed
                      her in her sleep. They were finally free, or so they
                      believed. With Graham gone, Rakesh and Dawa became the
                      most prominent presence in the region. They had been
                      revelling in abstinence for so long that they no longer
                      remembered how to withstand the impact of a rock, let
                      alone hundred thousand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">
                      In their final moments of that cycle, they heard the voice
                      of a child "Smoke and mirrors do not make you a god no
                      matter how many rabbits you pull out of your ass."
