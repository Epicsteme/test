                    Due to political pressure, G**gle maps shows different versions of p*litical borders depending on
                    who is viewing them.

                    In 2016, a person from the region known as New Zealand was detained in the region known as
                    Kazakhstan because local "authorities" believed that New Zealand was not an actual country, and that
                    the NZ passport was fake. When they were asked to bring a world map in order to be shown where NZ
                    was, it turned out that the map did not have NZ on it. The person from NZ eventually had to bribe
                    "the right people" in order to be allowed to leave.

                    I have been to many shops in India and have not yet found a shop that sells more than one kind of
                    globe or world map... especially those that label regions not as Finland, Norway, Germany but as
                    Suomi, Norge, Deutschland. The former labels are coined by "outsiders" and the latter by locals in
                    their respective native languages.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The difference in labels or terminology are insignificant in some contexts. However, people often
                    forget about variations and become attached to the version they were most exposed to, potentially
                    downplaying or rejecting knowledge they did not already possess.

                    The dangers of such (wilfull) ignorance can be witnessed throughout history especially as a result
                    of mistranslations or misinterpretations of r*ligious texts or "teachings."

                    is "a mental and emotional response in which a captive (e.g., a hostage) displays seeming loyalty
                    to—even affection for—the captor. The captive may come to see law enforcement or rescuers as the
                    enemy because they endanger the captor."

                    Nietzsche saw clearly how the displacement of r*ligion would impact humanity, and his insight was
                    that people would enslave themselves to the st*te instead of using the opportunity to gain freedom.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    There are potentially infinite perspectives, and no single perspective is absolute or the whole
                    truth. The will to a system is a lack of integrity.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    R*ligion ruined humanity for many centuries and eventually st*te began to take the lead.

                    The "education" industry is controlled by p*liticians and the p*liticians are el*cted by "common
                    people" because we are allegedly a dEmOcRaCy.

                    Dem*cracy shares the frameworks of monarchy and oligarchy. Dem*cracy seems great in principle, but in
                    practice, individuals are still being ruled by a group of people who also try and oppress or
                    manipulate freedom of press and quality of education in order to retain power over others.
                </p>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    For a healthy dem*cracy, you need education grounded on integrity which means the inclusion of and
                    respect for all perspectives. Does your education system, especially your teachers, provide positive
                    and constructive interpretations for all worldly elements and perspectives or do they censor or look
                    down on any element or worldview, especially those related to the nature of a human being such as
                    sexuality or other bodily functions?

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    An easy way to identify a destructive or unhealthy system is to look for taboos. The presence of
                    taboos is evidence that a society has to develop in ways that perhaps matter the most.

                    Many people claim that it was "wrong" for people who were labelled as Nazis to kill those who were
                    labelled as Jews, but they do not understand enough how the circumstance came to be or how the
                    genocidal acts were justified. More importantly, they do not realise how similar their own systems
                    are with those of Nazi Germany.

                    institutions or systems are in need of correction.
