              Many teachers, even those with years of experience, don't know how
              to handle students' mistakes in a constructive way.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In 2012, at a school in Chennai, a Class IX student stabbed a
              teacher to death. The news said the student was upset about being
              repeatedly reprimanded for not doing well in studies. Talking to
              other students, I learned that when the teacher complained, the
              student's parents took away his privileges at home. That just made
              him angrier.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Based on my experience with many teachers and trainee teachers in
              India, I wouldn't be surprised if students reacted angrily to
              teachers more often.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              It's important for teachers to have a productive attitude towards
              mistakes.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              First, point out mistakes clearly and specifically. For example,
              instead of saying "wrong," you could say, "This verb should be
              'goes,' not 'go.'"
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Second, don't shame or make fun of the students. If you do, they
              might feel embarrassed, upset, or ashamed. These feelings can
              stick with them and make them scared to try again.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Third, treat mistakes as learning opportunities. Make it clear
              that the mistakes aren't permanentâ€”they're just steps towards
              improvement. Explain why each mistake happened and what rule or
              concept it breaks.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Fourth, highlight what is correct alongside what is wrong. When
              students see both, it motivates them and clarifies the problem.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Finally, provide guidance for improvement. Show them how to fix
              their mistakes and how to avoid making the same ones next time.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              If teachers adopt this approach, mistakes stop being a source of
              shame or frustration. Instead, they become a stepping stone for
              real learning, and that's when teaching really works.
