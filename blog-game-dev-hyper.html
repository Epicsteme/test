                It was the first time that I completed a project. By the time
                this project began, I was already familiar with some of the
                basics of game design and development. So, I decided to make
                something similar to an existing game and tweak the design a
                little bit to allow me to improve my game designing skills while
                also learning to develop a game. I chose Space Invaders as it
                seemed relatively easier for me to execute and complete the
                project at the time.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                On one hand, not all the scripts are as good as they could have
                been in maintaining a lighter CPU workload. On the other hand, I
                took a few shortcuts with some parts of the development, without
                affecting the gameplay, to save time, and reduce the work load
                on the computer and on myself. For instance, the NPC ships
                circling the player character are attached to one empty parent
                object in the center which is scripted to rotate on its own
                axis. This helps in avoiding having multiple movement scripts in
                the scene while still achieving the same gameplay experience.

              </h3>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                The NPC fire rate varies within a fixed range based on the
                Player's Health State: higher the player health, higher the fire
                rate. The NPC rotation speed increases whenever the player hits
                an NPC rather than increasing over time. These mechanics
                synchronise the game's difficulty level with the player's skill
                level to some extent.
