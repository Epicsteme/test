                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The word “privacy” comes from the Latin word “privatus” which means "set apart (from what is public), belonging to oneself (not to the state), peculiar, personal" according to Etymonline.

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">Privacy, autonomy, democracy</h3>
                
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In the digital age, privacy has become increasingly complex, with concerns about data collection and surveillance on the rise. Privacy is a fundamental pillar of democracy, as it empowers individuals to exercise autonomy, fosters open political discourse, and protects citizens from manipulation by powerful entities.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Philipp Masur, whose research explores digital communication and social media’s impact on daily life, states that “Online privacy literacy has often been regarded as a requirement for informational self-determination. Without the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate online environments and to ensure the protection of one’s personal information as well as to limit other’s access to the self, people cannot be autonomous in communicating and using online services.”
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                   Democracy is a system of governance in which power is vested in the people, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes through elections. Autonomy is essential to democracy because it empowers individuals to make independent choices and express their opinions freely, which are fundamental aspects of democratic participation. Privacy is crucial for autonomy because it allows individuals to make personal choices and express themselves without external scrutiny or interference.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    “Loss of control over personal information may result in to loss of his right to decide for himself, his freedom to choose i.e. autonomy which ultimately result in to liberty” (Athavale, 2020)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Privacy plays a vital role in enabling independent decision-making and self-expression by providing individuals with the space to think, reflect, and act without external pressures. Privacy protects individuals from judgment, coercion, or manipulation, enabling them to engage in self-reflection and make informed decisions about their lives. Without privacy, the fear of surveillance or intrusion can stifle creativity and open dialogue, leading to self-censorship and conformity. When people have privacy, they can explore their thoughts and feelings freely, allowing them to make choices that align with their values rather than succumbing to societal expectations or peer pressure. This freedom from observation fosters creativity and personal growth, as individuals can experiment with different ideas and identities without fear of judgment or repercussions. Privacy ensures that decisions are made based on informed consent rather than external influence.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Privacy rights were recognised in ancient India as evidenced in texts such as Dharmashastras, Vedas, Purans, Smriti, Grihyasutra, and Arthasastra (Tripathi, 2022). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In a democracy, the ability to voice dissent, organize protests, and engage in political discourse is vital for holding those in power accountable. When individuals know they are being monitored, they may self-censor their opinions or refrain from participating in public discussions, which undermines the very foundations of democracy. Moreover, privacy acts as a safeguard against manipulation by powerful entities, such as governments or corporations, which may seek to exploit personal data for their own agendas. Without the protection of privacy, individuals become vulnerable to targeted misinformation campaigns and psychological manipulation designed to influence their beliefs and behaviors. By maintaining privacy, citizens can engage critically with information and ideas, fostering an informed electorate that can make choices based on their own values, ultimately ensuring the health of democratic societies. Thus, privacy is not merely a personal concern; it is a collective necessity that ensures the health of democratic societies and empowers individuals to resist manipulation and defend their freedoms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Innocent persons and those earning an honest livelihood should not be subjected to surveillance unless there is contradictory evidence on the record (Jajodia, 2002)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Mass surveillance undermines personal freedom and democratic principles. It creates an environment of constant monitoring that stifles individual autonomy and discourages free expression. When people know they are being watched, they may alter their behavior. This leads to self-censorship of their thoughts and opinions to avoid scrutiny or potential repercussions. This chilling effect can diminish public discourse, as citizens become reluctant to participate in discussions about sensitive issues, challenge authority, or engage in activism, thereby weakening the democratic process. Additionally, the potential for abuse of surveillance data by those in power poses a significant threat to civil liberties, allowing for discrimination, targeted harassment, and the suppression of dissent. Ultimately, mass surveillance creates a culture of fear that conflicts with the core democratic values of freedom, equality, and participation, leading to a more authoritarian atmosphere where individual rights are compromised.
                </p>

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Corporations often collect vast amounts of personal information, including purchasing habits, online behavior, and demographic details. Privacy safeguards ensure that individuals have control over their data and can decide what information they wish to share and with whom. Companies can use personal data to manipulate consumer behavior through targeted advertising and marketing tactics. When privacy is compromised, individuals may be subjected to manipulative practices that exploit their preferences and vulnerabilities, leading to unwanted consumerism and decisions that do not reflect their true interests. Protecting privacy helps safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches. When corporations fail to prioritize privacy, they increase the risk of personal data falling into the hands of cybercriminals, leading to identity theft and financial fraud.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Privacy is crucial for protecting autonomy and fostering a healthy democracy because it empowers individuals to make independent choices and express themselves freely without fear of surveillance or retribution. Autonomy relies on the ability to explore personal beliefs, ideas, and identities in a safe space, where individuals can engage in self-reflection and decision-making. When privacy is compromised, people may feel pressured to conform to societal norms or governmental expectations, which stifles creativity and personal growth. In a democratic context, privacy serves as a safeguard against manipulation and coercion by both state and non-state actors. It enables citizens to engage in open political discourse, voice dissent, and participate in activism without the fear of being monitored or persecuted. Additionally, privacy protects against the abuse of power, ensuring that individuals have control over their personal information and can resist unwarranted intrusions by authorities. Ultimately, privacy is a foundational element of both personal freedom and democratic integrity, allowing societies to thrive through diverse voices and active participation.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Philipp Masur states “Based on empirical findings that Internet users rarely implement privacy and data protection strategies, it has been suggested that they are simply not literate enough to make informed decisions in online environments.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In modern times, the technological advancement poses a serious threat to privacy. There is a need to spread awareness among end users (Malik, 2021). People should be aware of privacy policy (Tripathi, 2022). There is a need to promote education on decision-making and critical thinking from an early age (Sachdeva, 2023).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The responsibility of raising awareness regarding online privacy may be shared by a number of institutions including the school. Accordingly, it is crucial that school teachers are aware of the many dimensions of online privacy so that they may educate the youth regarding online privacy. A study (Killampalli, 2024) shows that the average online privacy literacy rate among B.Ed. students in Telangana state is 53.02%. The findings also show that the majority of them carry an average of 18.41% misconceptions about online privacy.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    In summary, privacy is not merely an individual concern but a fundamental pillar of democracy, empowering citizens to make autonomous choices and engage in open political discourse. The historical context of privacy rights, along with the current challenges posed by mass surveillance and corporate data collection, underscores the need for robust protections. As we navigate an increasingly interconnected and surveilled digital landscape, the threat to our privacy becomes more pronounced, making it imperative for individuals and policymakers alike to prioritize and advocate for robust privacy protections. By recognizing privacy as a collective necessity, we can ensure that democratic values are upheld and that every citizen has the freedom to think, express, and participate without fear of intrusion or manipulation.
