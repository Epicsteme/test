                Ever since I played games I wanted to make them myself. Things
                got easier when I found Game Maker.

                ><br />
                I'm not really sure. I've done Secret Santas in the past with
                friends. Perhaps the thought process was me thinking it would be
                cool to make a game for someone in a Secret Santa, followed by
                coming up with the idea that everyone makes a game. In other
                words: A game jam.

                Hosting Challenges

                  did you overcome them?</span
                ><br />
                The biggest challenge was the whole process of getting everyone
                a Santa and giftee. As soon as I planned on hosting the jam I
                started working on a Discord bot for this. At that point I've
                made my fair share of Discord bots already, so I had the
                experience. But there was a date planned for the jam, so I had
                to be quick. I actually pushed a change in the very last minute,
                right before the start of the jam. The start of the first jam
                was very chaotic, as things didn't work as planned. I was so
                stressed out that the next day my jaw hurt from clenching my
                teeth so much. The second and third year were a lot more
                streamlined, and no longer stressful.<br /><br />
                The fact that we used a Discord bot meant that we had to
                communicate to our participants that they need to join on both
                Itch and Discord. We edited the Itch page to make this very
                clear, but still we'll have about a hundred people who joined on
                Itch but not on Discord.

                ><br />
                I have no concrete plans, because when I do they fall apart. I
                am planning on making games, and will keep hosting the Secret
                Santa Jam. I don't have any plans for another kind of game jam,
                but if an idea pops up I'll go for it.

                Start early with organizing everything, and give people enough
                time to join. Sometimes starting the jam a week later might be
                worth it if it means you get more time to plan everything.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                Check for other popular game jams, and make sure the dates don't
                collide with yours. Hosting a game jam in the same weekend as
                LDJAM or GMTK is not a good idea.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                There are tons of game jams, so as soon as I open the page it
                should be clear what makes your jam special. Even better would
                be if it's in the title.
