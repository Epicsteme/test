              Dominance and Inequality
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Language is not merely a tool for communication; it also shapes
              social structures and cultural identities. When a foreign language
              is forcibly introduced into a region with its own local language,
              it can become dominant, resulting in social and cultural
              inequality. The foreign language acquires linguistic capital[1]
              and market value[2], providing economic and social advantages such
              as employment, access to services, and connections, while the
              local language is increasingly perceived as less important or
              prestigious.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              This dominance is maintained through symbolic power[3] and
              cultural hegemony[4], which cause individuals to internalize the
              perceived superiority of the foreign language, even when they
              continue to use their local language in private settings. As a
              result, speakers of the local language may develop a sense of
              inferiority.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The spread of the foreign language is often institutionalized and
              occurs at the expense of the local language. It operates similarly
              to systems of discrimination, such as racism or sexism, by
              privileging one group while marginalizing another. This process
              influences education, media, and public life, thereby reinforcing
              social inequality.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Over time, the foreign language spreads not by eradicating the
              local language, but by being perceived as more valuable and
              rewarded. As more individuals, particularly younger generations,
              adopt the foreign language, the local language weakens and may
              ultimately become extinct.

                mobility, especially when certain languages are seen as more

              Language Suppression in France
            </h2>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              The French government implemented policies to promote the use of
              French, aiming to unify the country through a common national
              language.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The decline of regional languages began in 1539, when the French
              government declared the Parisian dialect, Francien (Standard
              French), the sole official language.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The spread of Standard French was eventually driven by increased
              literacy and access to written language. In the 1880s, new
              education laws prohibited the use of regional languages in schools
              and imposed punishments on children who spoke them. The French
              administration propagated the belief that Occitan, a regional
              language, was merely a corrupted form of French, associated with
              ignorance and lack of education.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In 2021, a new bill known as Molac's Law attempted to permit
              instruction in regional languages across most subjects instead of
              French, but the French supreme court rejected that part, saying it
              went against the French constitution, which says French must be
              the language of the Republic.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Today, Occitan is spoken primarily by the oldest residents of the
              region, typically within neighborhood and family settings, and is
              likely to become extinct with the passing of this generation.

            <!--Part 2 Why English matters-->
            <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="why-english-matters">
              The Global Influence of English
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In a study conducted by the European Institute of Business
              Administration, Kai Chan developed the Power Language Index (PLI),
              which ranked languages based on five types of opportunities they
              offer: (1) Geography: The ability to travel, (2) Economy: The
              ability to participate in an economy, (3) Communication: The
              ability to engage in dialogue, (4) Knowledge and media: The
              ability to consume knowledge and media, (5) Diplomacy: The ability
              to engage in international relations.
            </p>

            <p class="lh-lg">
              After evaluating the effectiveness of over one hundred languages
              across these five domains, it was found that English is the most
              powerful language overall, and it ranks highest in all five areas.
              English holds the top position as the world's lingua franca.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Mandarin is gaining influence but still ranks a distant second.
              French takes third place, with strong results in geography and
              diplomacy. Next are Spanish, Arabic, and Russian, completing the
              top six—all of which, even without considering diplomacy, are
              official languages of the United Nations. German and Japanese,
              spoken in major economic powers, rank seventh and eighth. The top
              ten is completed by Portuguese and Hindi, both of which are also
              BRIC languages.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Language proficiency is a critical factor in global
              competitiveness. It is notable that eight of the world's top ten
              financial centers are located in cities where English is widely
              spoken or well understood.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              For individuals, language can help them succeed, and the index
              shows which languages are most useful. For business leaders, the
              index shows which languages are most important for reaching people
              worldwide. For policymakers, the index supports the idea that
              English gives people a big advantage.

              National Priorities
            </h2>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Multilingual countries should prioritize enhancing English
              proficiency across the population while simultaneously preserving
              local languages, rather than promoting the imposition of one
              specific language nationwide in the name of national unity. The
              colonial legacy of English is less relevant in contemporary global
              contexts. English is now one of the most widely spoken languages
              worldwide, serving as a lingua franca and providing substantial
              practical advantages over many other languages.
