                Introduction
              </h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                I recommend using
                <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> engine since it is
                free and open source.
                <br />
                There are two aspects to game development when you start out:
                technical and design. It is recommended to start by learning the
                technical aspects of the game engine by making games that
                already exist. Try pong and breakout. This way, you do not yet
                need to worry about balance in game design. Once you have become
                familiar with how to build something, start experimenting with
                game design and implement your own design.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="research">Research</h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Research plenty. Find and play a lot of games including those
                that are not popular. Deconstruct and analyse the games you
                play. Learn from experts through seminars, interviews, online
                videos such as Game Developer Conference. Watch and read reviews
                and criticisms. Increase your collection of perspectives.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Observe and learn from the world around you. Watch the way
                people behave, the way animals and insects behave. Ask yourself
                how you can gamify it. What is the person or the animal trying
                to achieve? What are they capable of doing and what are the
                obstacles? What can be added or removed to make it more
                entertaining? How can rewards be integrated?
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Ask yourself what can be changed in an existing game to make a
                different game or make it more entertaining. In order to be able
                to come up with ideas, you must first possess knowledge
                regarding the kind of things that can be added. For this, you
                need to research and find as much information as possible. If
                you are unable to solve a problem or do something effectively
                with the knowledge you currently possess, you should acquire
                more knowledge or change the way you see the information at
                hand.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Mental fixedness is a barricade to creativity and you should try
                to see things from more than one perspective. Learning from
                everyone and everything allows you to see things in many
                different ways.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                Provide challenges to the player along with the tools and
                information necessary to overcome the challenges. The tools and
                information should be given at a reasonable pace instead of
                everything being handed to them at once and overwhelming them.

                is an indie game with a clear concept from the beginning. The
                player quickly understands what to do and how. Once the
                foundation is established, challenges are introduced. The jug
                movement becomes more challenging as it comes close to being
                empty. The player can also manually choose a harder mode by
                picking up a specific glass.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Challenges are of many kinds. Examples of motor skill based
                challenges include controlling a race car or a character in a
                platformer. Other kind of challenges are focused on the player's
                cognitive processes such as memory or problem solving skills,
                and these can be seen in puzzles and strategy games.

              <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Feedback (audio, visual, haptic) is a crucial part of
                communication. Feedback can often encourage the player to repeat
                an action or avoid it. What usually makes a videogame effective
                is constant feedback.
              </p>

                >, filling a glass with water, despite being a simple and
                ordinary concept, is made interesting through feedback (and
                challenge).
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                There is a wide variety of audio feedback for every action that
                can be performed by the player. There is feedback when a glass
                is picked up, when it is put back down empty, when it is being
                filled, when it is put down full, and when it falls down.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Some games provide haptic feedback through controller for almost
                every little thing happening on the screen. This makes
                interactions and the whole experience more responsive and
                immersive.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                Information is crucial to the player in making decisions. When a
                player fails to complete a task, it should not be so because the
                game did not provide them adequate information or in a clear
                manner. Whenever the player does something or tries to do
                something, the game should provide informational feedback to let
                the player know what their actions are achieving or not
                achieving.

              <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="testing">Testing</h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Have your game playtested by a few people before releasing it.
                Players often find bugs and glitches you may have missed, and
                playtesting also helps in evaluating how effective the game
                design is.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                If your game's difficulty level seems reasonable to you, it will
                most likely be extremely challenging to the players. This is
                because you understand how your own game works and you have
                played it many times, but a new player will try your game for
                only about 20 seconds before deciding to drop it if they do not
                like it or understand it.

                it is unlikely to ever be finished. It is through experience and

                Why game Jam?
              </h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                A <a href="https://itch.io/jams">game jam</a> is an event where
                participants try to make a videogame from scratch. It can have
                rules and a theme, and it usually lasts between one day and one
                month. Game jams are opportunities for you to prototype ideas
                and check whether they are as good as you thought they would be
                before making a large game. You also get to meet new people and
                learn from them. Networking is also great if you plan on
                building a career in this field.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="team">Team</h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Most game jams have Discord servers. Join them to find
                teammates. Team up with one or two members—ideally an artist and
                a music composer. Having someone working along with you makes it
                easier for you to focus on your own speciality.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h2 class="text-left display-6" id="resources">Resources</h2>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Gather references for visuals and audio so the artist and music
                composer would know what kind of aesthetic and mood to aim for.
              </p>
              <p class="lh-lg">
                Create a shared spreadsheet with a list of all the required
                assets and progress. Allow your team to update the spreadsheet.
                This helps the team to see quickly and clearly what is required
                and how much is completed.
              </p>

              <p class="lh-lg">
                Working as a team can also lead to a better game since each
                element has a specialist working on it. However, having too many
                teammates can be challenging to coordinate with and to maintain
                consistency if you are a beginner.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                Keep the scope small. Spend most of your time polishing the core
                mechanics, gameplay loop, and the level design. More mechanics
                does not necessarily mean it is a better game, but a game with
                well-polished mechanics and gameplay means it is more likely to
                be a good game. It is better to full-ass a few things than
                half-ass many things.

              <p class="lh-lg">
                At the end of the jam, take feedback from other developers and
                from players, and reflect on it. Write down the feedback
                somewhere easily accessible—maybe in the project folder. This
