              You may have been led to believe it's “good” to be vegetarian. But
              what matters isn't what someone chooses but why they choose it.
              There are three things that reveal whether someone's morality is
              genuine.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              First, it's about desire and command. There's a difference between
              someone who simply lacks the appetite for meat and someone who
              feels that desire but chooses to shape it. The first isn't
              virtuous — they're just harmless. They call their emptiness
              virtue. The second feels the desire and still decides, “I rule
              myself.” It's about the strength to order their drives instead of
              being ordered by them.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Second, it's about why the person refrains. One says, “I don't eat
              meat because I feel pity, guilt, or disgust.” That comes from fear
              — fear of life's force, fear of strength itself. It's weakness
              disguised as virtue. The other says, “I could eat meat and enjoy
              it, but I choose not to, because I command myself.” That's not
              fear — that's power. It's the difference between running from
              desire and standing above it. The first kind avoids temptation;
              the second masters it.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Third, it's about awareness of other arguments. Some arguments
              don't condemn eating meat at all — they encourage it. They see
              appetite and strength as natural, even admirable — expressions of
              life and vitality. So if a person has only ever been told that
              eating meat is “wrong,” their morality isn't real; it's
              brainwashing. They're just repeating what they've been told, like
              a photocopy machine.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              But the one who knows that another way exists — one that praises
              appetite and strength — and still chooses restraint out of their
              own will, that person is truly moral. Because they've seen both
              sides, felt both pulls, and made a conscious decision.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The weak avoid meat because they must. The strong avoid it because
              they can. One imitates virtue. The other creates values.
