                  This game was made for The Fresh Game Jam 2021. I chose to
                  make a platformer as I was looking to improve my skill in
                  designing levels for platformers. I was inspired by a fancy
                  little indie platformer called Un-Evergreen by Motor in which
                  you have a limited number of jumps. I applied the concept of
                  limited jumps to fit the theme "management" (you have to
                  manage your jumps) and worked on improving my level designing
                  skill.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                  Designing the level for this game was tricky since the player
                  has a limited number of jumps to use. Among other things, this
                  restriction forced me to come up with the pink platforms that
                  gave a free instant jump for the player character, adding
                  variety to the gameplay as well as the level.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                  I created multiple scripts, each with a specific mechanic or
                  behaviour, allowing me to quickly apply any script to any
                  platform that I thought needed that mechanic or combination of
                  mechanics.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                  In order to improve my skill in creating sprites, I made my
                  own art for most parts of the game using LibreSprite. The
                  brick sprite is reused in both foreground and background with
                  slight change in colour to differentiate one from the other.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                  The banners on the wall are hints that convey to the player
                  where they need to use a jump. I set the hints to be invisible
                  by default and added the ability to make them visible on a key
                  press so that the player can choose whether they want the
                  hints, allowing them to change the difficulty level of the
                  game at any time.
