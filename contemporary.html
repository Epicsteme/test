                <p class="lh-lg">
                    The purpose of this page
                    is
                    to spread awareness of certain things that are likely to help people better understand themselves,
                    others,
                    their surroundings, and hopefully to help them grow
                    mentally and emotionally.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Metacognition is the awareness or analysis of one's own learning or thinking processes, often
                    involving
                    regulation of the processes. This helps one learn better and come up with effective solutions to
                    problems.

                <h3 class="display-6">Schema</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Schemas are mental structures that represent ideas or a person's knowledge which help them with
                    perception and interpretation of things.
                    While schemas help reduce the time it takes to interpret something, they can also limit one's
                    ability to understand something novel or influence their perception of it. Types of schemas include
                    self schema, object
                    schema, person schema, event schema.

                <h3 class="display-6">Cognitive Dissonance</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Cognitive dissonance is a mental state in which there is a difference between one's experiences or
                    behaviour and one's
                    beliefs about what is true.
                    <br><br>
                    Cognitive dissonance creates a motivational drive in a person to reduce
                    the dissonance (similar to hunger). An individual is likely to reduce cognitive dissonance in one or
                    multiple ways- (1) accept new information and change
                    one's attitude or behaviour; (2) reject evidence and look for information to attempt to justify
                    inconsistency in one's behaviour; (3) trivialise the dissonant behaviour or the importance of the
                    attitude.

                <h3 class="display-6">Cognitive Bias</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Cognitive bias refers to deviation from rationality in judgement. Types of cognitive biases include
                    confirmation bias, attribution bias, dunning-kruger effect, etc.

                <h3 class="display-6">Confirmation Bias</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Confirmation bias is the tendency to gather and favor evidence that confirms one's preexisting
                    expectations while
                    dismissing or failing to seek contradictory evidence.

                <h3 class="display-6">Attribution Bias</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Attribution bias refers to inaccurate assumptions and faulty judgements of other people and their
                    behaviour. It is based on attribution theory which focuses on identifying how an observer
                    creates a causal explanation for events.
                </p>
                <hr class="my-4">
                <h3 class="display-6">Dunning-Kruger Effect</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Dunning-Kruger effect refers to the tendency of people with low ability or expertise regarding
                    something overestimating their own ability or knowledge.

                <h3 class="display-6">Mental Rigidity</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Mental rigidity is the inability to appreciate or entertain a new perspective. It can also refer to
                    the
                    inability to modify schemas once they are formed; and completing tasks in only one manner despite
                    more effective alternatives being available.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    A fallacy refers to invalid or faulty reasoning in an argument. Some of the
                    examples include straw man, ad hominem, a priori, fallacy fallacy, appeal to probability,
                    reductionism, etc.

                <h3 class="display-6">Reductionism</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Reductionism is the oversimplification of something complex. It also refers to the assumption that
                    there is only a single, simple cause
                    of an outcome when in fact, there may have been many causes.

                <h3 class="display-6">Survivorship Bias</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Survivorship bias is the tendency to focus on entities that have passed through some selection
                    process and ignoring those that did not. This leads to the formation of incorrect judgements and
                    conclusions due to the bias in selection.

                <h3 class="display-6">Self-fulfilling Prophecy</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Self-fulfilling prophecy refers to a prediction that causes itself to become true
                    as a result of the expectation that it would come true. If a person thinks
                    something will happen, they may consciously or unconsciously make it happen through their actions or
                    inaction.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if a teacher believes that a student is unlikely to achieve great things
                    in life, the teacher may reduce their effort in guiding the student since it would save the
                    teacher's time and energy. This causes the prediction to come true as the student would be ignored
                    or misguided.

                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand and regulate one's own feelings, and understand
                    others' feelings and behave accordingly to avoid or solve problems. It is possible to improve one's
                    own emotional intelligence through reflection, meditation, etc.

                <h3 class="display-6">Communication Barriers</h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">
                    Communication barriers are factors that prevent an idea from being effectively shared between the
                    speaker and the listener.
                    <br><br>
                    You are
                    more likely to overcome barriers and share your ideas effectively when
                    you identify and understand the factors that limit communication.
                    <br><br>
                    Communication barriers can be categorised into linguistic barriers, psychological barriers, physical
                    barriers, socio-cultural barriers, technological barriers, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples for communication barriers include lack of open mindedness, lack
                    of mental health, lack of vocabulary, misinterpretation, distance between the speaker and the
                    listener, etc.
