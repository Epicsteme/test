                        <p>
                            This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. The theme was "chain reaction." This was the first
                            time
                            that I took part in a game jam, and it was also the first time that I worked with a deadline
                            as
                            short as one week. I teamed up with JDR, a developer that I met in the Jam's Discord server.
                            We
                            helped each other work on our own individual games rather than collaborate on a single game
                            due
                            to the significant differences in our schedules. We shared and bounced ideas off of each
                            other,
                            exchanged feedback, play-tested and helped polish each other's games.

                        <h3 class="display-6">Time management</h3>
                        <p>
                            As it was the first time that I attempted to make a game under a week, I had no idea on how
                            to
                            manage my time effectively. JDR introduced me to Trello, which I used to prioritise the game
                            mechanics and plan out the development of the game. Most of the week was spent on polishing
                            the
                            level and fixing bugs. I implemented the core gameplay, pause menu, main menu, and uploaded
                            a
                            playable version before the deadline.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <br>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Level Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            Designing a level was a rudimantary skill at the time. I looked up key-terms relevant to the
                            theme and found a few interesting results of random objects set in a dominoes-like-effect. I
                            thought that it would be cool to have a level in which all the platforms are set in a chain
                            reaction.
                            <br><br>
                            Though I used physics simulation for only some parts of the level, I managed to maintain the
                            appearance of a chain reaction throughout the level. As I was not yet experienced enough
                            with
                            level designing, I could not build a bigger level or multiple levels. Using platforms with
                            diverse mechanics, I built one level which can be completed in approximately one minute.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <br>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Bugs</h3>
                        <p>
                            A large ball in the level was supposed to hit a pillar that would knock pillars over.
                            However,
                            when the ball touched the first pillar, it did not tip over in some playtest sessions. To
                            fix
                            this, I decreased the mass of the pillars, increased the mass and the force of the ball,
                            increased the torque on the pillars by a reasonable amount to make sure that they would
                            completely tip over but not spin like a top. The pillars now tip over as expected.
                        </p>
