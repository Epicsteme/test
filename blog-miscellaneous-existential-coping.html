            <!--post is written in layman terms-->
            <p class="lh-lg">
              In<em> The Last Messiah</em>, Peter Wessel Zapffe discusses the
              human condition and our struggle with the awareness of existence.
              He argues that humans suffer because their strong thinking ability
              and self-awareness make them realize life is meaningless,
              pointless, and the fact that death is unavoidable. To cope with
              this existential anxiety, Zapffe identifies four main defense
              mechanisms that people use to suppress these difficult truths.
              This article discusses these four mechanisms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="display-6">Isolation</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Isolation means pushing away or not thinking about painful or
              scary thoughts. In everyday life, people usually avoid talking
              about heavy topics like death to keep things comfortable and easy.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Isolation only works for a little while. The real problem doesn't
              go away; it just hides inside. Later on, these thoughts can come
              back even stronger, which might cause serious stress or emotional
              problems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="display-6">Attachment</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Attachment means holding on to things that feel safe and familiar,
              like family, home, or beliefs. These attachments make us feel
              secure and help protect us from scary or hard realities. To keep
              life stable, people build systems like religion, laws, and
              traditions that act like walls holding everything together.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Attachment can be fragile because it's based on beliefs that
              aren't fully true or on hopeful thinking. When real life
              challenges these beliefs, a person's feeling of safety can fall
              apart, which may lead to a crisis or deep sadness.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="display-6">Diversion</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Diversion means staying busy all the time with activities like
              work, watching TV, or hanging out with friends. People use
              diversion to avoid thinking about things that upset them. It's
              like a plane that has to keep flying; if it stops, it will crash.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Diversion can help for a little while, but it doesn't solve the
              real problem. If you distract yourself too much, life can feel
              empty, and you won't be ready when trouble hits.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="display-6">Sublimation</p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Sublimation means taking your bad feelings and using them to do
              something good instead, like creating art. This works best if the
              pain isn't too overwhelming or if the person deals with it before
              feeling hopeless. Artists are good examples of people who use
              sublimation.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Sublimation is different from the other three because it helps
              people face life's problems and turn them into something valuable
              or beautiful, instead of hiding or ignoring their pain.
              Sublimation is the healthiest and most mature way to deal with
              life's hard realities.
