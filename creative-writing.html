                        <div class="accordion-body">
                            It is said that in Ooreville, which lies on the hill Kathihill, a cursed sword stands on the
                            cliff that no man dares touch for it may strip them of the light in their minds.
                            <br><br>
                            This I can believe for I had an uncle, when I was a child, who visited the town to study the
                            phenomenon. Later that night, he was seen walking off the cliff.
                            <br><br>
                            Though some believe the sword fell from a world beyond our own, the scriptures allege it
                            belonged to a man whose face the world shall forever be a stranger to.
                            <br><br>
                            The heavens whispered, in his dreams, of a fair maiden bound in a tower on the cliff. The
                            stars tethered his heart to her. He swore to find her and free her. His destiny awaited.
                            <br><br>
                            Stars drifted across the nights as he travelled across many lands, some of which were known
                            only to a few. He carried with him a sword and a bag filled with the eyes of those that dared cross his path.
                            <br><br>
                            On the walls of the tower sat a shadowy figure whose nature was not of the known world. It
                            seemed to be a sort of monster, or a shadow of a monster, of a form only an ill mind could dream up. Its
                            form resembled parts of moth and deer. An antlered head surmounted a stretched body with ripe
                            wings. Its ragged figure, darker than night, hazier than dreams, twitched and flickered like flames.
                            <br><br>
                            The blade passed right through the misty void that it was. There was no bloor nor hurt.
                            <br><br>
                            With a penetrating gaze, the man marched towards the door and right through the void. Each
                            breath cost him dearly his strength, and will had faded from his body. His chest, on fire, grew
                            heavy. A crushing ache crowned on his head. Consciousness waned. Had he not turned around as soon as he
                            did, the void would have consumed him.
                            <br><br>
                            A few moments passed before he caught his breath and gathered enough strength. Upon brief
                            contemplation, he dashed right back in with a speed that was nearly not meant to be.
                            <br><br>
                            No matter how great his speed was, nor how long he ran for, he came no closer to the door.
                            Soon he was back out trembling like a featherless bird.
                            <br><br>
                            How would you kill what you could not touch?
                            <br><br>
                            He sat under a tree and contemplated the horizon as it swallowed countless suns. Memories of
                            those that had set him on that path gathered for a summit.
                            <br><br>
                            An ocean of voices condensed all around him. They are but mirages in which he drowned. The
                            air turned to cuttlefish. A subtle pattern of warm chaos spiralled. In its eye, he lay
                            paralysed, gasping for breath.
                            <br><br>
                            In the distant corner of the summit was a bar in which a man sat with a bottle, grieving his
                            lately missing eye. A chuckle silenced the memories. In the newfound quiet, the heavens
                            whispered once again.
                            <br><br>
                            The sword rested by a stone and footsteps approached the door to the tower. The floating
                            abyss swirled and flickered but did not suffocate.
                            <br><br>
                            Silence greeted him upon entering the tower. He paced up the stairs to the chamber at the
                            top. Cold air turned stale and his breath numb. A strange yet familiar face greeted him. He fell
                            on his knees, and a river ran down his face. He had finally found whom he had come to rescue. In
                            the middle of the naked room, there stood a dust covered mirror.

                                A young lass sat in a garden of stars.
                                A constellation of fireflies flocked around her. A spell of
                                breeze stole her veil away. Her face to the parted sun. Freckles on the cheek. A bite on
                                the neck. A subtle glance at the heavens.

                                Tattered clouds resembled the beach at dawn. Bare foot, a stroll down the coast. A
                                crescent shining shell peered through grains of cloud. How I wish I could carry it in a
                                jar
                                of
                                glass.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fiery clouds scattered down the horizon. The sky- red as a dragon's breath. From a
                                slumber awakened the beast - cosmic in nature, astronomical in scale. Lids humbly parted
                                over
                                the eye that robbed the sky of its light and bled through a cloak of clouds.

                                She pulls on my gaze yet she lingers away. The wind whispers in her voice. The ocean
                                stumbles under her breath. Her gaze- paralysing; her touch- subtle yet professing; her
                                kiss-
                                deadly.

                            as
                            eagles soared with an appetite. A plague of pigeons scrambled unceremoniously; they
                            circled
                            back
                            to the start and gathered as they were. Thrice the eagles have returned- wave after
                            wave,
                            they
                            missed their prey. Upon being left alone by their predators, the pigeons sought company
                            among
                            their own. The mating rituals soon have been interrupted by the cold showers from the
                            west.

                            Strange, winged creatures stood still in the shade of a cracked wall. Their feathers
                            were of
                            colour akin to that of wood under rain. Their eyes were dense as the void; a
                            constellation
                            of
                            tiny specks glowed from within.
                            <br><br>
                            A child approached the creatures with a bowl of seeds. He sat with his back to the wall
                            and
                            let
                            out a breath of prayer. As he tossed a handful of seeds on the ground in front of him,
                            the
                            creatures began to move. In the midst of the crowd was a youngling. From beneath its
                            eyelids, a
                            thin layer of skin crawled out, masking the void. The creature flew up to the bowl and
                            indulged
                            itself. The rest waddled around pecking at the ground in remarkable unison.
                            <br><br>
                            Later that night, incomprehensible noises flooded the dreams of the child, turning them
                            to
                            cryptic nightmares. He woke up only to find the noises still haunting him. The source,
                            he
                            realised, was outside.
                            <br><br>
                            Motivated by curiosity and fuelled by annoyance, he moved towards the door to the
                            balcony.
                            With
                            every step, hesitance slowed him further, his curiosity grew stronger, his heart beat
                            louder.
                            <br><br>
                            An eternity passed; he turned the knob and pushed the door wide open. An obscure being
                            with
                            a
                            translucent form sat among dense clouds. A swarm of lightning traversed around it in
                            ways
                            unnatural.
                            <br><br>
                            Ripples of screeches echoed out of the dark of the night. Dense little shades moved in
                            front
                            of
                            the clouds. The winged creatures were as fast as their screeches. They moved with the
                            grace
                            of a
                            dancer and the swiftness of a fighter. The ripples of screeches collided with the swarm
                            of
                            lightning, denting the very fabric of reality around them.

                            The glass, tinted unevenly, did not open. On the other side are a great many windows
                            placed
                            symmetrically on walls of unsaturated colours. I could not count them all if I had an

                            At a distance, a group of younglings, full of life, stood tall waving their hands at the
                            speeding train. I imagine they must have not seen me, for I am behind a tinted glass.
                            Would
                            it
                            have been of any consequence to return the wave?

                            The Gods painted the heavens with a symphony of colours. Never have I laid the slightest
                            glance upon a spectacle so terrifyingly breathtaking.
                            <br> <br>
                            Something peeked out of the sky. Its skewed body, scattered edges, and obscure being
                            mocked
                            me.
                            <br> <br>
                            "Does that look like a rabbit to you?"
                            <br> <br>
                            A strange yet comforting voice stole my senses. I wonder why I wasn't expecting company.
                            To
                            my side is a child whose attention could not be taken off the clouds.
                            <br> <br>
                            The hind legs make it look more like a hare than a rabbit.

                            "Sure," I replied.
                            <br> <br>
                            I gazed beyond to find a thin, subtle yet paralysing stroke of violet bordering a thick
                            fiery cloud. With all its might, the sky, on fire, roared bright.
                            <br> <br>
                            What does that one look like to you?

                            Little Lenny pulled a .44 Magnum from his wrinkled robe, demanding to know who the
                            "snitch"
                            was. Helicopters circled the mansion, and the special ops were closing in. The new kid
                            dropped
                            to the ground with a new hole in his head. I knew that I was the last person that Lenny
                            would
                            suspect, but I needed his men alive. I realised what I had to do even though it was
                            against
                            the
                            protocol. I blew my cover, and I apprehended Little Lenny. Before his men could
                            successfully
                            put
                            a bullet in me, special ops stunned them. You should have seen the look on Lenny's face-
                            he
                            was
                            speechless, realising that I was not who he thought I was. It was not the first time
                            that I
                            have
                            seen that look on someone. In fact, it was the same look that I have when I see faces
                            staring
                            back at me in the mirror.

                            For a while now, I could tell that she liked me too. After what felt like an eternity, I
                            felt a
                            real connection with someone. Considering that it was about time, I invited her over to
                            my
                            place
                            for dinner. Each second felt like an hour as I waited for her. She enjoyed the meal that
                            I
                            had
                            cooked for her, and she joked that I should have been a professional chef. The hour was
                            late
                            and
                            something was in the air. Excitement followed as she pulled her hair back, smiling at
                            me.
                            All
                            the stars aligned perfectly and the angels blessed me. Leaning closer to her, I gently
                            touched
                            her lips with mine. Everything else faded out of focus. Red lips turned to blue as I
                            stole
                            her
                            face.

                            On the midnight of 13 April 2919, our broadcast had been answered by a particularly
                            intelligent alien species. They sent us their own "Arecibo message."
                            <br><br>
                            It took us nearly a decade to decipher their message. When we did, the experts
                            concluded that the alien civilisation was a Type II on the Kardashev scale, and
                            recommended
                            terminating the communication.
                            <br><br>
                            If history had taught us anything, it is that the encounters between civilisations with
                            advanced versus primitive technologies have gone badly for the less advanced.

                            The laughter turned to loud gasps. I dashed to the interns' lab down the hall. The time
                            tunnel
                            started rumbling. <i>What happened?</i> Everyone started sobbing and crashing to the
                            floor.
                            Sam,
                            however, did not move an inch, nor did he make a sound. He looked like he had just seen
                            a
                            ghost.
                            The control pad slipped out of his grip and hit the floor. I looked around the room
                            trying
                            to
                            assess the situation.

                            The cries faded out of focus, as did the rumbling of the tunnel. The pounding of my
                            heart
                            was
                            all that I felt. I raced to the screen and pulled up the transfer log.
