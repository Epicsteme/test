          <h2 class="display-6">Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lh-lg">
            This game is a vertical-scrolling 2D platformer with random level
            generation and surreal comedy, designed for casual players in the
            browser. Created for Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2 with the theme "RISK
            IT for the BISCUIT." The jam lasted one week. I was the game
            director and lead developer. I've teamed up with two programmers,
            RobyDev from Spain and Shinespark from India; an artist, Francisco
            Martins from Portugal; and a composer, Aylinel from Germany.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">The Initial Idea</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I came up with the concept for this game while thinking about taking
            risks for collectibles. The player starts at the bottom, climbs up
            the platforms, collects biscuits, and comes back down before the
            time ends. Will the player take a risk and go higher to collect more
            biscuits or will they come back down? The random level generation is
            meant to increase replayability value.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Early Prototyping</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            We started prototyping in Unity. The first version of the level
            generator spawned only one platform per row and there was a
            possibility that a platform would spawn right above another platform
            leading to the player character being unable to climb that platform.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Iteration and Problem Solving</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            One of the biggest challenges was designing the level. I wanted the
            player to have more than one way to go up. This meant there had to
            be more than one platform per row. I also wanted to have an easy way
            and a hard way. The easy way would have higher chances of spawning
            biscuits and fewer chances of spawning enemies while the hard way
            would have higher chances of spawning enemies and fewer chances of
            spawning biscuits.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            One of the variations I tried had three platforms per row. This was
            discarded as it was not leading to an interesting level design.
            Another variation I tried had only two platforms per row and this
            lead to an occasional problem where the space between the two
            platforms would be too high and the player character would not be
            able to jump from one platform to the other in the same row. I
            solved this problem by measuring the distance between the two
            platforms in a row and spawning a third platform in between them if
            the space was too high. This lead to a balanced level design with
            two platforms in some rows and three in some rows.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            To prevent only one side being easy and the other side hard, I wrote
            the code in such a way that the game would randomly choose between
            left and right side for the easy and hard platforms to be spawned.
            In the early version, biscuits and enemies would spawn on every 5th
            row. This was later changed to every 4th row and then to every 3rd
            row. This decision was made so that climbing platforms would feel
            more interesting with collectibles and enemies appearing more
            frequently.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            The enemy drones are spawned on the right side of the screen and
            moved to the left side. At times, the player character would be too
            close to the drone when it was spawned and the player would not have
            enough time to move away from the drone. To solve this problem, I
            wrote the code in such a way that the drone would be spawned only
            when the player character is in the center or left side of the
            screen.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="display-6">Art, Audio, and Narrative</h2>
          <p class="lh-lg">
            I wanted the art style to be painterly and the audio to feel like it
            was made with real instruments. I asked the composer to create
            gameplay background music that would feel similar to Super Mario
            Bros and Double Dragon II themes. I wanted the narrative to feel
            silly and surreal. So, we came up with the idea that an employee is
            being ordered by their boss to carry out a strange task.
