                        <p>
                            It was the first time that I completed a project. By the time this project began, I was
                            already familiar with some of the basics of game design and development. So, I decided to
                            make something similar to an existing game and tweak the design a little bit to allow me to
                            improve my game designing skills while also learning to develop a game. I chose Space
                            Invaders as it seemed relatively easier for me to execute and complete the project at the
                            time.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Shortcuts</h3>
                        <p>
                            On one hand, not all the scripts are as good as they could have been in maintaining a
                            lighter CPU workload. On the other hand, I took a few shortcuts with some parts of the
                            development, without affecting the gameplay, to save time, and reduce the work load on the
                            computer and on myself. For instance, the NPC ships circling the player character are
                            attached to one empty parent object in the center which is scripted to rotate on its own
                            axis. This helps in avoiding having multiple movement scripts in the scene while still
                            achieving the same gameplay experience.

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Dynamic Difficulty</h3>
                        <p>
                            The NPC fire rate varies within a fixed range based on the Player's Health State: higher
                            the player health, higher the fire rate. The NPC rotation speed increases whenever the
                            player hits an NPC rather than increasing over time. These mechanics synchronise the game's
                            difficulty level with the player's skill level to some extent.
                        </p>

                            Royalty free font "OpenDyslexic" was used in order to provide a relatively better experience
                            to players
                            with dyslexia.
