              There are various kinds of map projections, and each one distorts
              reality in its own way. Some projections are meant for general
              use, some for navigation, others for showing ocean currents,
              climate data, or distances from one specific spot on Earth. Each
              projection chooses what to preserve—shape, direction, area,
              distance, or aesthetic balance. And in doing so, each map
              sacrifices something else. It distorts area, shape, scale, or
              distance.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              The same thing happens with how we understand the world. We create
              systems (interpretations)—religions, philosophies, scientific
              models. Each one has its own way of making sense of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              No single map projection shows the Earth exactly as it is. No
              single system shows the world exactly as it is. Friedrich
              Nietzsche said the will to a system is a lack of integrity (In
              other words, trying to fit everything into one neat, perfect
              explanation of reality isn't honest). Gautama Buddha advised not
              to become attached to systems.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Don't rely on ready-made systems to tell you what matters. Create
              values and meaning through your own experience and strength. Stop
              hiding behind comforting explanations. Accept that life is chaotic
              and uncertain. See yourself as work in progress—always
              questioning, growing, and becoming.
