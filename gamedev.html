                    each
                    member
                    receives a letter
                    containing information regarding the interests of the writer. We had to develop a game that
                    includes
                    something relevant to the interests of the writer.

                    The person who wrote to me offered a choice between a rhythm based game and a visually appealing
                    platformer.

                <p class="gamedevlog">While researching platformers and rhythm games, I found a game called "140"
                    where
                    the level and the
                    platforms are in sync with the background music. I wanted to try and make something similar.

                    This would include both the choices I was offered- rhythm based and visually appealing
                    platformer.

                    I teamed up with a music composer from the jam's discord server.
                    They communicated efficiently, produced quality music and delivered in a timely manner.

                <p class="gamedevlog">I chose to make a platformer rather than something like Rhythm Heaven Fever
                    since
                    I wanted to improve
                    my skill in designing platformer levels.

                    Though this game does not have a spectacular level design, I did learn a few new things and set
                    a
                    direction for the improvement of my skills.

                <p class="gamedevlog">I created a behaviour script that I used as a template for most of the
                    platforms.
                    The values for
                    movement speed, start position and end position were manually entered for each platform after
                    attaching the script.

                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">A subtle detail that I added to the audio visualiser is that each bar has a
                    different set of values:
                    the sensitivity and maximum height of the bars in the higher difficulty areas are higher than
                    that
                    of the bars in the lower difficulty areas of the level.

                <p class="chapterhead">The Catch</p>
                <hr width="806px">

                <p class="gamedevlog">The audio visualiser flashes random colours in sync with the beats. This may
                    be a
                    potential trigger
                    for those who suffer from epilepsy or have health conditions that are triggered by bright
                    flashing
                    lights.

                    I added a clear warning of the flashing lights in both the download page as well as in the main
                    menu
                    of the game. In retrospect, I realise that I should have added an option to disable the flashing
                    of
                    the visualiser, and display the warning in the loading screen as well.

                It was the first time that I completed a project. By the time this project began, I was already
                familiar with some of the basics of game design and development. So, I decided to make something
                similar to an existing game and tweak the design a little bit to allow me to improve my game
                designing skills while also learning to develop a game. I chose Space Invaders as it seemed
                relatively easier for me to execute and complete the project at the time.

                On one hand, not all the scripts are as good as they could have been in maintaining a lighter
                CPU
                workload. On the other hand, I took a few shortcuts with some parts of the development, without
                affecting the gameplay, to save time, and reduce the work load on the computer and on myself.
                For
                instance, the NPC ships circling the player character are attached to one empty parent object in
                the
                center which is scripted to rotate on its own axis. This helps in avoiding having multiple
                movement
                scripts in the scene while still achieving the same gameplay experience.

            <p class="gamedevlog">
                The NPC fire rate varies between a fixed range based on the Player's Health State: higher the
                player
                health, higher the fire rate.
                The NPC rotation speed increases whenever the player hits an NPC rather than increasing over
                time.
                These mechanics synchronise the game's difficulty level with the player's skill level to some
                extent.

                    This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. The theme was "chain reaction." This was the first time
                    that
                    I took part in a game jam, and it was also the first time that I worked with
                    a deadline as short as one week. I teamed up with JDR, a developer that I met in the Jam's
                    Discord
                    server. We helped each other work on our own individual games rather than collaborate on a
                    single

                    We shared and bounced ideas off of each other, exchanged feedback, play-tested and helped polish
                    each other's games.

                    As it was the first time that I attempted to make a game under a week, I had no idea on how to
                    manage
                    my time effectively. JDR introduced me to Trello, which I used to prioritise the game mechanics
                    and
                    plan out the development of the game. Most of the week was spent on polishing the level and
                    fixing
                    bugs.

                    I implemented the core gameplay, pause menu, main menu, and uploaded a playable version before
                    the
                    deadline.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    Designing a level was a rudimantary skill at the time. I looked up key-terms
                    relevant to the theme and found a few interesting results of random objects set in a
                    dominoes-like-effect. I thought that it would be cool to have a level in which all the platforms
                    are
                    set in a chain reaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Though I used physics simulation for only some parts of the level, I managed
                    to maintain the appearance of a chain reaction throughout the level. As I was not yet
                    experienced
                    enough with level designing, I could not build a bigger level or multiple levels. Using
                    platforms
                    with diverse mechanics, I built one level which can be completed in approximately one minute.

                    A large ball in the level was supposed to hit a pillar that would knock pillars over. However,
                    when
                    the ball touched the first pillar,
                    it did not tip over in some playtest sessions. To fix this, I decreased the mass of
                    the pillars, increased the mass and the force of the ball, increased the torque on the
                    pillars by a reasonable amount to make sure that they would completely tip over but not spin
                    like a
                    top.

                    The pillars now tip over as expected.

                    This game was made for The Fresh Game Jam 2021. I chose to make a platformer as I was looking to
                    improve my skill in designing levels for
                    platformers.

                    I was inspired by a fancy little indie platformer called
                    Un-Evergreen by Motor in which you have a limited
                    number of jumps.

                    I applied the concept of limited jumps to fit the theme "management" (you have to manage your jumps)
                    and worked on improving my level designing skill.

                    Designing the level for this game was tricky since the player has a limited number of jumps to use.
                    Among other things, this restriction forced me to come up with the pink platforms that gave a free
                    instant jump for the player character, adding variety to the gameplay as well as the level.

                    I created multiple scripts, each with a specific mechanic or behaviour, allowing me to quickly apply
                    any script to any platform that I thought needed that mechanic or combination of mechanics.

                    The banners on the wall are hints that convey to the player where they needed to use a jump. I set
                    the hints to be invisible by default and added the ability to make them visible on a key press so
                    that the players can choose whether they want the hints, adding a bit of control over the difficulty
                    of the game.

                    In order to improve my skill in creating sprites, I made my own art for most parts of the game
                    using LibreSprite.

                    The brick sprite is reused for the platforms as well as the background, with slight change to the
                    colour to differentiate one from the other.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    This game was made for Weekly Game Jam. Since the theme "Siesta" refers to
                    relaxation, I wanted to make a game that offers a relaxing experience for the players. This was the
                    first time that I worked on a rhythm based game.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    The scripts and the development process are significantly different in a rhythm based game.

                    In most games, you write the script in such a way as to synchronise the game objects and other
                    elements with the frame rate in order to maintain consistency in gameplay experience. In a rhythm
                    game, however, syncing the game elements with the frame rate causes the gameplay to lose
                    synchronisation with the music.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of connecting with delta time, some of the game elements were coupled with real time clock
                    to maintain consistency, especially in the scrolling speed of the arrows.

                <p class="gamedevlog">
                    The arrows carry trigger boxes to check for the overlapping of the appropriate arrows. The box sizes
                    are relatively large in size so that the players may not feel pressured to achieve pixel perfect
                    accuracy in a game about relaxation.

                    Royalty free music was used for Ode to Joy and the sound of rain. If the player misses too many
                    beats, the rain slowly fades and the sky becomes bright and clear.
                    Owlbert the workaholic owl wakes up from his nap and flies off to work. In order to keep the game
                    less
                    punishing, I kept the music playing and the arrows scrolling so that the players may still continue
                    playing and enjoy the music.

                    Krita was used to draw the owl and the background. The owl in the rainy scene is a different game
                    object from the owl that flies off if the rain stops. I used two different objects in order to make
                    it convenient to script its behaviour.
